So basically when u turn on the lights and turn them off again the light is gone and the black energy ""dark matter"" will fill the room ?? times faster than light speed and the whole unseen universe doesnt have any light source which makes dark matter expand infinatly and this dark matter isnt even matter so if u go by any way to the unseen universe u will be stuck there forever as theres no time there same as black holes, but difference is that black holes are matters but dark energy isnt matter.

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-14 04:54:40,0.0,"Dark matter is quite real.
Check it out. Here's the most probable approach to the problem.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",https://youtube.com/shorts/Vp8r5AOR688?si=PMlX8puCdwxwilhy

@SLAUGHTERBG,2023-09-19 17:47:18,0.0,"Dark matter accounts for five times as much of the universe as ordinary matter. However, we know little about it other than that it only interacts with ordinary matter through gravity. Despite our lack of knowledge, scientists do have overwhelming indirect evidence for dark matter. For example, scientists can explain how galaxies rotate and how the large-scale structure of the universe forms and evolves by dark matters existence. The term dark matter was coined in 1933 by Fritz Zwicky of the California Institute of Technology to describe the unseen matter that must dominate one feature of the universethe Coma Galaxy Cluster. The galaxies in the Coma Cluster were moving too quickly for as much mass as there appeared to be, and dark matter was a potential explanation. In the 1970s, Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institution found evidence for dark matter in her research on galaxy rotation. But the nature of dark matter remains a mystery.

Scientists have several candidates for the types of particles that make up dark matter. One possibility is that dark matter is made of WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) that would have 1 to 1,000 times more mass than a proton. Another candidate is the axion, a particle ten-trillionth of the mass of an electron. In theory, axions would convert to a particle of detectable light (called a photon) in the presence of a strong magnetic field. Alternately, dark matter may also exist in a rich and complex set of particles.",https://youtube.com/shorts/Vp8r5AOR688?si=PMlX8puCdwxwilhy

@michaelkahn8744,2023-05-19 03:52:50,8.0,"Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly suggested model of Universe can easily explain Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.

However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?

The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1,  ?2,  ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.

The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter.

Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.

Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.

As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy",https://youtube.com/shorts/Vp8r5AOR688?si=PMlX8puCdwxwilhy

@shawns0762,2023-01-07 13:17:09,0.0,"There is an elephant in the room explanation for ""dark matter"". Most people don't know that Einstein said that singularities are not possible. In the 1939 journal ""Annals of Mathematics"" he wrote ""the essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the Schwarzchild singularities (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The Schwarzchild singularities do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light""
   He was referring to the phenomenon of dilation (sometimes called gamma or y) mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. This is illustrated in a common 2 axis dilation graph with velocity on the horizontal line and dilation on the vertical. It shows the squared nature of the phenomenon, dilation increases at an exponential rate the closer you get to the speed of light.
   General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein is known to have repeatedly spoken about this. Nobody believed in black holes when he was alive for this reason.
   Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass, dilation will occur because high mass means high momentum. There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy.
   According to Einstein's math, the mass at the center of our own galaxy must be dilated. In other words that mass is all around us. This means that there is no valid XYZ coordinate we can attribute to our own galactic center, you can't point your finger at something that is smeared through spacetime. Or more precisely, everywhere you point is equally valid.
   This is the explanation for the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter) the missing mass is dilated mass.
   According to Einstein's math, galaxies with very, very low mass would not have dilated mass because they do not have enough mass at the center to achieve relativistic velocities.
   To date, this has been confirmed with 5 very low mass galaxies all showing no signs of dark matter, in other words they have normal star rotation rates.

@AwsomeKArl,2024-09-03 00:11:24,0.0,"(Ima start start yapping ??) Dark matter is a mysterious form of matter that makes up approximately 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content, according to current cosmological models. Unlike ordinary matter, which consists of atoms and subatomic particles, dark matter does not interact with electromagnetic radiation (such as light) and therefore cannot be directly observed with telescopes.

The presence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Observations of the rotation of galaxies, the motions of galaxy clusters, and the bending of light (gravitational lensing) all suggest that there is more mass present in the universe than can be accounted for by visible matter alone. Dark matter provides the additional gravitational pull needed to explain these observations.

Despite its name, ""dark matter,"" its exact nature remains one of the greatest mysteries in modern physics. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain dark matter, including exotic particles such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or Axions, as well as modifications to the laws of gravity on large scales (e.g., Modified Newtonian Dynamics or MOND). However, as of now, dark matter has yet to be directly detected in laboratory experiments, and its precise composition and properties remain unknown. Ongoing research efforts aim to shed light on the nature of dark matter through a combination of astronomical observations, theoretical modeling, and experimental searches.",https://youtube.com/shorts/B-RDmPLmasw?si=Nj5qLyfDu6Iy1MV5

@michaelkahn8744,2023-12-11 05:34:01,0.0,"Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity and Accelerated Expansion
- 4-D Hypershere model of Universe can easily explain Gravitation, Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Void, Accelerated Expansion and even the reason why the measurement values of Expansion Rate are around 70 km/sec-Mpc 

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Void and Antigravity, ... all these are same phenomena. They just look different.
The problem of modern physics is they're trying to explain everything with particle physics and the physics is being cornered more and more to the dead end. To escape the dead end, they invent or design another imaginary particle in vain instead of trying to revise their way to approach to the problem.

I agree to the idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.
But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.
That's because gravity is not a force.
Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Antigravity, Void... all these are  just  joint effects of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.
Details are given below.

Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1, ?2, ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter. Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.

I did some research. What I found at the time was pretty insightful. Dark matter doesn't really interact with electromagnetism. Strong and weak force aside the only thing we know about dark matter its its gravitational influences. 

The key here is that when dark matter tries to clump there's nothing really stopping it, such as an EM repulsion via electrons in normal matter. 

So if it begins to collapse it just doesn't really stop.. there's no ""seed"" no protocore to form a blackhole or in this case a planet. It just kinda passes by /through the other dark matter. Nothing stops and interacts TO collapse into anything.

What Brian Cox explains here about dark matter resonates wonderfully with this ancient text: 

Tao Te Ching  Verse 1

The tao that can be told
is not the eternal Tao
The name that can be named
is not the eternal Name.

The unnamable is the eternally real.
Naming is the origin of all particular things.
Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

Yet mystery and manifestations
arise from the same source.
This source is called darkness.

Darkness within darkness.
The gateway to all understanding.

@michaelkahn8744,2024-11-04 04:29:15,0.0,"Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.

However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?

The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1,  ?2,  ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.

The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter.

Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.

Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.

As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy",https://youtube.com/shorts/13L0RwV8qAw?si=xJiAjOYUOiW0YrSF
@SophiaAphrodite,2024-11-04 02:27:34,0.0,My theory is this. Dark Matter is gravity without mass.

@michaelkahn8744,2023-08-05 18:18:52,0.0,"Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.

However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?

The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1,  ?2,  ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.

The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter.

Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.

Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.

As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy",https://youtube.com/shorts/0PIJ-v6-OYQ?si=l7qVAuaBA22ThhCL

@shawns0762,2023-04-04 16:58:01,1.0,"There is no dark matter. Most people don't know that Einstein said that singularities are not possible. In the 1939 journal ""Annals of Mathematics"" he wrote ""the essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the Schwarzchild singularities (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The Schwarzchild singularities do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.""
   He was referring to the phenomenon of dilation (sometimes called gamma or y) mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. This is illustrated in a common 2 axis relativity graph with velocity on the horizontal line and dilation on the vertical. Even mass that exists at 75% light speed is partially dilated.
   General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein is known to have repeatedly spoken about this. Nobody believed in black holes when he was alive for this reason.
  Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass, dilation will occur because high mass means high momentum. There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy.
   According to Einstein's math, the mass at the center of our own galaxy must be dilated. In other words that mass is all around us. This is the explanation for the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies, the missing mass is dilated mass.
   According to Einstein's math, galaxies with very, very low mass would show no signs of dark matter because they do not have enough mass at the center to achieve relativistic velocities, therefore they are not infused with dilated mass. This has recently been confirmed with galaxy NGC 1052-DF2. This is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon in galactic centers, there can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.",https://youtube.com/shorts/0PIJ-v6-OYQ?si=l7qVAuaBA22ThhCL
@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-14 04:45:48,0.0,"The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last.

Look up node edging, weighted and unwieghted and once you grasp the function, apply edge weight to the gluon strings connecting the quarks. All the energy popping in and out of existence inside the nuclei of the proton is the gluon field applying the wieghted measure.

When we are in free fall in a gravitational field we are in a state of unweighted measure. This just means instead of the gluon field giving weight to your mass it's forcing you to rest in the field. When you are at rest in the field its applying your weight.

This is why when you go to the moon your body weight will change to reflect the strength of the gravitational field you come to rest in.

There is nothing at all about the geometry of a sphere that would change my body weight nothing at all. Unless that sphere was so small it was smashing me down with force.

But if a supernova happens the dark energy conserved in the star or matter would disperse out of it, in search of new matter to co-exist with. This is all the info Ive collected for the 2 minutes Ive done research on it.. then again it would also cover most of the energy that would be able to be detected by satellites, which comes to the conclusion/summary that dark matter or dark energy is most covering the universe we have not yet discovered.",https://youtube.com/shorts/APINXTuJpdo?si=Fmb4gU7w3THRmmmv

@michaelkahn8744,2023-08-27 04:47:04,0.0,"Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity and Accelerated Expansion
- 4-D Hypershere model of Universe can easily explain Gravitation, Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Void, Accelerated Expansion and even the reason why the measurement values of Expansion Rate are around 70 km/sec-Mpc 

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Void and Antigravity, ... all these are same phenomena. They just look different.
The problem of modern physics is they're trying to explain everything with particle physics and the physics is being cornered more and more to the dead end. To escape the dead end, they invent or design another imaginary particle in vain instead of trying to revise their way to approach to the problem.

I agree to the idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.
But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.
That's because gravity is not a force.
Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Antigravity, Void... all these are  just  joint effects of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.
Details are given below.

Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1, ?2, ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter. Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.

@michaelkahn8744,2023-06-29 11:57:08,0.0,"The problem of modern physics is they're trying to explain everything with particle physics and the physics is being cornered more and more to the dead end.

The interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.
But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.
That's because gravity is not a force.
Gravity is just a joint effect of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.
Details are given below.

Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1, ?2, ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter. Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.

@jaymethodus3421,2023-06-15 15:16:12,0.0,"There is no dark matter, these are the remnant cores of the universes first super mega galaxy cluster duster black holes. They were relatively poofy globulous puddles of dense dipole pair soup. a state of Proto-crystalline hyper-realness; I.e the probabilistic distribution functions of all potential values of energy converge on a specific point within determinable rangeof probabilities, as far as the EH perimeter, where this dipole proto hyper real soup stuff starts shooting off protons and negative mass anti electrons in opposite directions. Protons decay into neutrons and high energy antipair virtual particles that collapse and annihilate cyclically releasing energy as EM waves. The neutrons are short lived and the energy of EM wave releases, is enough over pressure energy to break them back into - and + pairs. The first hydrogen atoms in the universe. After this process, a solid mass of neutral heavy particles in hyper-real probability lock relative to eachother(the particles are still technically infinite heat and can not be jostled from their energy states until the heat death of the universe basically), is leftover- inside the infinity contained within the singularity, with almost no mass, but still technically an infinite energy binding the remaining mass to that point.

The remaining cores are a new state of matter that have mass contained in an infinity-rest equilibrium state while in cold space; meaning almost no external energy pressures; without affecting local gravity vectors at all, but still affected BY the overall gravity vectors of other matter. This state of matter conserves Energy in an easier way than bending space time. I believe at absolute rest, it simply emits what can only be thought about as negative space pushing outwards from the perspective of being in the center, yet from outside looking in, it would appear to be matter with no mass. As it gains energy above its rest state it emits real space to conserve momentum. The end of the first era of black holes like the one I theorize, leaves us this new state of matter in huge quantities, and an overpressure of hot hydrogen/protoreal virtual dipole soup. Only after the first black holes began to cool off into their hypercrystalline spherical shapes, did they emit negative space sufficient enough to allow for EM radiation diffusion to lower the proton electron pairs energy levels enough to form REAL hydrogen atoms.",https://youtube.com/shorts/RNotDTJHO0U?si=log1btgXlUeBWvEB

I still believe that dark matter is a tunnel we should have never gone down. I have no basis behind this, but I believe in time we will find that our understanding of gravity is incorrect. How can it both be a curvature in spacetime & a force carrying particle? We already have evidence of spacetime curvature through gravitational lensing. I truly believe the Graviton will forever be hypothetical l. Similar to MOND, it may be that we need MOGR (Modified General Relativity)

Also, the subatomic particles of the standard model were predicted decades before they were proven through experimentation. There has never been a reliable theory of dark matter. All we have is, it's a high mass particle that only interacts gravitationally. It's wasn't predicted prior to experimental evidence, it was theorised as a correction for the discrepancy in mass:angular momentum within galaxies because physicists had no explanation.

@michaelkahn8744,2023-05-29 22:05:36,11.0,"Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1, ?2, ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter. Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Void and Antigravity, ... all these are same phenomena. They just look different.

The problem of modern physics is they're trying to explain everything with particle physics and the physics is being cornered more and more to the dead end. To escape the dead end, they invent or design another imaginary particle in vain instead of trying to revise their way to approach to the problem.



I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.

But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.

That's because gravity is not a force.

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Antigravity, Void... all these are  just  joint effects of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.

Details are given below.

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-19 00:12:01,0.0,"Kaku says beware dark matter and dark energy.
It's mysterious and.... dark.
Schmart? Right.
He knows this stuff.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

And since it's so uncondensed it can go into other liquid smoke energy that makes up fields...
As the dark matter becomes condensed so does the energy in the field that's in the dark matter... It Becomes so compacted it pulls in other energy from its field .... Condensing the dark matter and the energy inside of it and then the energy that makes up field and becomes so condensed that the dark matter can still act like a ghost... But the energy in the field that got more condensed because of the dark matter is now pulling in more of its energy from its field most likely causing gravity",https://youtube.com/shorts/wjqBQ2YrvV8?si=21CgKL-8Ffr9zYsR

@ismarilsupergaming8321,2024-03-09 23:22:56,0.0,"Umm actually Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to make up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, hence the term ""dark."" Dark matter is invisible and does not interact with electromagnetic forces, making it extremely difficult to detect with telescopes.

The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies, gravitational lensing, and the large-scale structure of the universe all point to the presence of additional mass that cannot be accounted for by visible matter alone.

Despite extensive efforts to detect dark matter directly, its exact nature remains unknown. Various theoretical particles have been proposed as candidates for dark matter, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions, but none have been conclusively detected.

The study of dark matter is a major area of research in astrophysics and cosmology, as understanding its nature is crucial for a more complete understanding of the universe and its evolution.ð¤ð",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIdgqyNOl7Q

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-14 04:43:50,0.0,"The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIdgqyNOl7Q

@AmyDaryleKonczal,2023-08-19 13:22:07,3.0,I solved it!!! Dark energy and expansion are being caused by the repellent effect of cold. And as empty space expands it creates more empty cold voids at close to absolute zero which has magnified this effect at a rate matched by its increase in space and accompanying increase in cold area pushing everything apart causing expansion. I've watched a glass of ice water push condensation away from my glass on my table. So does that repellent effect grow along with the drop in temperature approaching absolute zero it would increase at same rate as expansion as well proving my theories correct.

@michaelkahn8744,2023-04-14 16:37:55,52.0,"Alternative Explanation of the two Dark Ghosts

Einsteinâs theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.

However, we also observe gravitational effects â curvature of spacetime â in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed â it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now â why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?

The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system â 3 angular coordinates, Ï1,  Ï2,  Ï3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.

The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubbleâs surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local âmountainsâ and âvalleysâ on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of âdark matterâ.

âValleysâ in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So âdark matterâ is really âvalleysâ in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies â regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, âmountainsâ in spacetime will repel matter away, an âanti-gravitationalâ effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.

Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The âmissingâ energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.

As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the âcircumferenceâ of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2Ï light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*ã10ã^6  kmâs)/(2Ï*4233Mpc)=(1.88*ã10ã^6  kmâs)/26598Mpc=70.82(kmâs)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted. â Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIdgqyNOl7Q

Born from the primordial cauldron of cosmic inflation, it burgeons forth, a cosmic symphony orchestrated by the harmonious interplay of fundamental forces. Within its boundless expanse, galaxies dance in cosmic ballets, birthing stars that illuminate the cosmic canvas with their incandescent radiance.

Yet, amidst this celestial grandeur, lurk enigmatic entities known as black holes, gravitational behemoths that warp the fabric of spacetime itself, swallowing all that dare to venture too close, ensnared by their voracious gravitational embrace. These cosmic anomalies, born from the cataclysmic deaths of massive stars, serve as cosmic sentinels, guardians of the cosmic order, where the laws of physics are stretched to their limits and our understanding of the universe is put to the test.

Through the lens of modern cosmology and quantum mechanics, we endeavor to unravel the mysteries shrouding the universe's genesis, its evolution, and its ultimate fate. From the cosmic microwave background radiation that whispers the secrets of the universe's infancy to the elusive dark matter and dark energy that pervade the cosmic tapestry, each discovery unveils new layers of complexity, challenging our perceptions and beckoning us towards a deeper understanding of the cosmos that we call home.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSThUhFMiJY

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-14 04:45:05,0.0,"The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GEZ95TJ5Ao

Just like when you put water in a cup filled with oil, water comes to surface and ""glue"" itself in a isolate layer not because there's a force that put water molecules togheter, difference in density make 2 substance to separate naturally, same thing happens in universe, matter is ""floating"" inside a space made of dark matter, so the region of space  that contain more matter, is surrounded by more antimatter, just like an invisible cloud around it...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GEZ95TJ5Ao

@TomHendricksMusea,2023-12-19 16:16:53,0.0,"Dark Energy and Dark Matter May Be Anti Gravity.

This  makes a case for anti gravity, not gravity, as the force that comes from acceleration.

Einstein recognized that acceleration was equivalent to the force of gravity. He said that this was the happiest thought of his life.

Had he known that 95% of the universe was not matter but Dark Energy and Dark Matter, he would have recognized that acceleration  was the equivalent to the force of ANTI GRAVITY.
He would have seen that it wasn't gravity from matter; but anti gravity from empty space  that was the force.

The diagram shows how dark energy and dark matter from empty space push back more and more against matter as it accelerates.

Top, the globe has no acceleration. 
Next picture, there is some acceleration and  the arrows show resistance from empty space as the globe moves forward.
Finally as the globe  approaches the speed of light, the resistance from empty space becomes massive and approaches infinite.
No matter can travel at the speed of light.

DARK ENERGY;  Dark energy is energy that expands. In every part of the universe. It acts like anti gravity and is associated with the vacuum of space.  My Suggestion is that this is a force of anti gravity expansion.

DARK MATTER ;  Dark matter is labeled as a gravitational pull.  Yet there are no baryons - no matter - that's been found to do the pulling. Many physicists are looking for the missing matter.  My suggestion is the obvious - it's not there!  The force is anti gravity that we know is there.  That means dark energy and dark matter are the same thing.  They are both antigravity.

Together dark energy and dark matter, or both together as anti gravity, represent 95% of the universe and they represent a single expansion force everywhere.  Finally this may well be the same force that began with the Big Bang expansion,

Here is a diagram showing  the make up of the universe.
95% anti gravity (dark energy + dark matter) and 
5%  hydrogen and helium gas, stars, neutrinos, and all other atoms combined.

 Here's some support.  There is a cosmological redshift that comes from the expansion of space itself. The galaxies are not moving, but the intervening space is stretching.

What is dark energy in simple terms?

Think of dark energy as the ""evil counterpart"" to gravityâan ""anti-gravity"" force providing a negative pressure that fills the universe and stretches the very fabric of spacetime. As it does so dark energy drives cosmic objects apart at an increasingly rapid rate rather than drawing them together as gravity does.Nov 24, 2022

Okay, so if other universes leek gravity into ours, we should also leek into theirs, meaning their would be no noticeable difference. 2.) If 1 isnt true, then the other universe would have way less gravity then it produces. 3.) If your referring to ""dark matter"" then the other Univers would have to be at least 5  or 6 times ours in size, but most likely way more then that. 4.) And this is most important, this ideas implies that we are completely wrong about gravity on every level their is. And by this i mean gravity isnt alone by itself. It takes a massive object to create gravity. Yet he's implying that gravity can just move on its own, and jump to anothet Universe without the mass that created it. Which would also mean that we could move gravity around, we just have to figure out how. 

And these are just the obvious implications of what he's saying. And im not trying to prove, or disprove anything here.

For some strange intellect in me, said there's more to space than the people around you know about. Whenever I said something about it, I was told to sit in the corner of the classroom and think of a way to apologize to the nonsense I had said. Even in high school, everyone in my science class laughed at me when I said the Sun rotated and moved in space with the solar system rotating around it.

So, after high school, I wrote a sci-fi book about a character made up of black energy and dark matter. I took some of the laws of space and time and created my own worlds in this book. And at most times, I wish I could leave earth and go there.

They love to dissect everything in the to study it. From a frog, to atoms, planets to galaxies. But theyâre still looking from the outside in. Which means they will always be on the outside looking in know matter how much they study matter on its smallest or grandest scales.

The physicist will describe their experience of it and be excited about how much they learned about the mechanical workings of it, but thereâs still much more to learn to complete the experience.

That's not really a mystery. I don't understand why people want to make it a mystery. Space is not empty. Asteroids, Meteors, the Oort cloud, interstellar debris.
Dark matter...until it isn't.
Matter releases energy. It decays, it evaporates, it reacts, it sublimates, it does a bunch of other things as it changes from being matter or to other forms of matter.
We can't see this going on out in the void of space.
Its dark.

On the most basic level, the equation says that energy and mass (matter) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing.

I have a computer which draws 230w of energy and the monitor draws 43w of power. 230/43 = 5.348837209302326 gives us our power ratio.

In this system the systems hardware is consuming 5.3x more energy than the display device of the system.

This correlates with Dark Matter and Ordinary matter.

26.8/4.9=5.469387755102041 that gives us our dark matter to ordinary matter energy ratio which is quite comparable to my system example above.
