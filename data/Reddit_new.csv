godowskyliszt,2023-08-02,2.0,"It's also worth noting that we DO see classical radial velocities in some galaxies. In direct response to OPs post, I would wager it's precisely the absence of a purported effect of DM that strengthens the case FOR DM. For example, in any MToG model, the same physics has to hold uniformly, so we shouldn't be able to spot galaxies that DON'T have a behavior consistent with the MToG in question. Yet such galaxies do exist; many of these can be Googled or seen in various research papers, like AGC 114905 et al...

In other words, more broadly, if an explanation for phenomenon X by DM is theory A and one by modified gravity is theory B, the fact that B has to hold in every case strengthens the evidence for A if X is not observed everywhere X applies. While we don't know enough about DM to profer an explicit mechanism for e.g. ""dark matter stripping,"" the absence of DM effects in some galaxies strengthens the applicability of that theory over one relying on modified theories of gravity.

You can see that there's a discrepancy in the location of the visible matter and where a sizable chunk of the actual mass is located.

The problem so far with MOND has been it explains a few things better than General Relativity and dark matter, but then can't explain a number of things that dark matter does explain, such as the Bullet Cluster.

For example, we've measured the masses of distant galaxies using gravitational lensing, and they seem to have a bunch of extra masses.

I'm a bit confused by this. The way I learned formation of star systems the disk structure is formed by giving the initial cloud a spin. Without the spin the cloud would have a tendency to just collapse in itself but with the spin in place the angular momentum of the particles close to the ""equator"" will keep them from drifting in so the cloud will collapse into a disk.

delventhalz,2021-02-19,2.0,"Sounds like what you were told was correct, just incomplete.

So in your version of things, you have a cloud of material, and it starts to collapse under its own weight. Overall, the motion of the material averages out to rotation in some direction or another, and as the cloud collapses, that weak initial rotation speeds up like figure skater pulling in their arms. Thanks to centripetal force, gravity is partially resisted along the plane of rotation, but wins everywhere else, and the cloud becomes a disk.

The reason this story is incomplete, is because it only really works if the cloud starts motionless. We think of things in space as just sort of floating around, so intuitively that makes sense, but the reality is quite the opposite. Things in space are always moving. Fast. This is why gravity does not cause the Earth to crash into the Sun. We're moving, and that movement keeps us in a stable orbit.

Similarly, a cloud of material is not motionless. The contents are whizzing about at various speeds and various orbits. So how does gravity win? Friction. When two particles collide, they lose a bit of speed, and they fall a bit closer to the center. As more and more collisions occur, gravity wins more and more, and the disk structure emerges through the process you outlined.

But what happens if collisions are impossible or at least exceedingly rare? Gravity doesn't win. Particles just keep flying around. Without friction, they never lose speed, and if they never lose speed, they will never fall in. Gravity will bend their path into some sort of orbit, like the Earth, but the particles cannot actually be pulled closer without friction. So the cloud stays and you never get a disk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lmas9d/where_is_dark_matter_theoretically/

>A problem with alternative hypotheses is observational evidence for dark matter comes from so many independent approaches.

Nonetheless, there have been some scattered successes for alternative hypotheses, such as a 2016 test of gravitational lensing in entropic gravity and a 2020 measurement of a unique MOND effect.

Davidjb7,2021-02-18,14.0,"To answer your question more clearly than some other answers: It depends on the theory! 

For instance, I worked on a team at Indiana University that studied Axions which are a candidate for dark matter. The theory we were specifically testing essentially told us that there was some non-zero probability that Axions were around us at any given moment. Additionally, the theory predicted that these Axions would act in very particular ways! By designing an experiment that systematically eliminated external variables and focused in on the single action which the theory predicted, we were able to disprove that very specific axion theory in the parameter space we were approaching. 

Part of the issue with many of these theories which predict dark matter and exotic particles is that currently they aren't ""falsifiable"". All that means is that within the constructs of the theory, there is no currently realizable experimental setup that can give you a negative response. For example: If I say there is a unicorn on the roof that blesses me, it is very simple for you to disprove this theory by walking outside and looking and then relaying to me that there isn't a unicorn there. A more difficult theory though is that there is a unicorn on the roof that becomes invisible whenever you look at it! This once again can be solved by putting cameras outside and watching the roof. Finally, if I say there is a perfectly invisible unicorn on the roof that is invisible because light does not interact with it, you might be truly be stymied. If a theory, in its convolutions, does not make predictions which can be checked and tested against, then in my biased experimentalist opinion it isn't worth a damn.

OliverSparrow,2021-02-18,7.0,"There are literally dozens of theories about DM, and literally dozens of problems with explanations for DE. The two taken together are required to raise the energy density of the universe sufficiently to make it ""flat"", which other observations prove it to be. Conventional matter accounts for only 5% of the mass density that is needed. 

DM is needed if equations describing gravity are to be correct. If they are lightly modified - MOND - then it isn't needed. Only a few observations are not wiped away if MOND is true. The Tully Fisher relationship - between galaxy brightness and rotation rate - is stronger if DM is excluded. 

If MOND is incorrect, however, then we need a particle that feels only gravity. You can't detect it because it doesn't interact with your detector, and gravity is a very weak force that it is indetectable from individual particles. Nevertheless, tanks of xenon await literal bumps and collisions from DM, and have so far failed to find them. The favoured particle is the axion, a theoretical particle that has never been detected but which should have the right characteristics: very light but with mass, present in vast numbers. So light is the axion that its wave function should be large - metres in length - delocating the particle in spacetime. There are notions of blobs of axions, called fuzzballs,, but like their parent these have never been seen.

Dark energy is evident in the accelerated pace with which galaxies are retreating from each other. We know that the early universe had to go through a period of extremely fast expansion, termed 'inflation'. What drove inflation is not known, but it is thought to be a field that was curled up or under tension at the Big Bang but which unwound very quickly, ripping spacetime open. DE is likely the residue of this field, although why is exists today with the strength that it shows is not at all clear. There are all manner of model as to what teh inflaton field was and how it acted. One of the more alarming is quintessence, which ahs DE as intrinsic to a given volume of space. As the universe expands, so quintessence outgrows matter, increasing the strength of DE without limit. A Big Rip is inherent to the theory, pulling elementary particles appart a few billion years into the future.

> If dark energy is constant all around us do that mean that there is no dark energy outside of visible universe because otherwise dark energy in all directions should cancel itself out? 

So as I understand dark energy, it is (in theory) creating new space. So there would be dark energy outside the visible universe (along with stars and gravity and everything else), but it is creating new space _everywhere_. The result is that we see the visible universe expanding faster and faster, and an observer outside our visible universe would see the same thing.

> Does dark energy apply a force 1/r2 from empty space or is the force constant?

I don't know whether dark energy would fall off with the inverse square law (maybe?). But it should exist at a low level everywhere, including space that has stuff in it. So you wouldn't really notice if it did. Everywhere you measured you should get the same level of dark energy. It's just that in the space within galaxies, dark energy is easily overpowered by gravity.

> Is the dark matter force vector on earth known based on out position and speed in the galaxy?

Good question! At a guess, I would say yes. We know how fast we are orbiting the center of the Milky Way, so we know how much extra gravity their must be to keep us from flying off. That said, this is getting into the math deeper than I am familiar with, so I am not sure of any exact numbers.

> Do galaxies rotate fixed like a solid planet or with variable angular velocity like the solar system?

Stars orbit the center of galaxies with variable angular velocity. The large-scale structures we see like arms are not fixed, they are density waves slowly circling around. Like waves in water, no one water molecule is a part of a wave. Instead the wave passes through the molecules, each of which have their own motion.

At that extreme range, a single WIMP would be more massive than any single atom of baryonic matter (i.e. protons + neutrons, the periodic table).

By the way, we have already detected some pretty hefty particles (like the Higgs boson or the top quark), which are as massive as a hundred or more protons. That makes them individually more massive than _most_ atoms on the periodic table, but not larger elements like uranium.

So a hypothetical WIMP could be in that same range, or potentially an order of magnitude or two outside it. I believe some of our experiments have ruled out some masses and narrowed down the possibilities, but I am not sure off the top of my head what those ranges are.

WIMPs might well _never_ collide with anything ever. Even if they are very massive. If they do collide, but just very rarely, we might be able to detect them in a similar way to neutrinos, and some experiments have been set up to that effect, but they have yet to spot anything.

eliminating_coasts,2021-08-26,1.0,"To add to what has already been said, general relativity can be stated in an enormously simple way:

The curvature of space is dependent in a big way on the distribution of energy and momentum.

Is it directly proportional? No, because that would mean that curvature is conserved whenever matter and energy are conserved, which would give us lots of saddle shapes instead of bowls.

But if we do one tweak to our distribution of energy and momentum in our equation, (called trace reversing it) then we can cancel out the effect of conservation of energy and momentum, and get curvature almost directly proportional, except that it doesn't care whether energy is conserved or not.

Then we can take certain cases that we know from newtonian physics to set our constants, and we have general relativity!

(According to Mark Carrol, from whom I got this explanation) curvature is about as close to proportional to the density of energy and momentum as it could be.

So when people go looking for adjustments to the theory, the most natural place to look is new forms of matter and energy that behave differently, because in almost all cases we can see some gravitational disturbence, flip it through the equation, guess there's a certain mass density, and see it with another telescope.

I should mention that you are making a classic mistake about Occam's Razor.  Occam's Razor doesn't say the simplest solution is more likely, it says the model with the fewest parameters is more likely (depending on the value of the likelihood that is).  The difference is the former would rely on an individual's personal knowledge of the field while the latter is a quantifiable metric.  Dark matter has essentially 1 parameter: the dark matter density.  If you are going to say ""there is an issue with our models"" then you need to provide a better one.  Saying a single model is incorrect without providing some relation to an alternative model is meaningless in science because everything in science is a model and [all models are wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)... but some are useful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/oy3q4n/why_do_most_scientists_believe_that_dark_matter/

Astrokiwi,2021-05-08,5.0,"Put it this way: Isn't it more probable that there's a currently undiscovered type of particle with only slightly different properties to particles we have already observed, rather than postulating some arbitrary change to our laws of physics to magically explain away the discrepancy?

We know neutrinos exist, we produce them in nuclear reactors and detect solar neutrinos quite routinely. A neutrino is a particle that only interacts via the weak nuclear force and gravity. It has most of the properties you expect from a hypothetical dark matter particle. But we rule it out as the main source of dark matter based on how we know neutrinos are produced, how massive they are, and how fast they go. Basically, there's not quite enough of them, and they are individually too light and move too quickly, so they shouldn't form the galaxy sized halos we observe.

What you should take from this is that we actually understand something about particle physics. We know how subatomic particles move and interact with each other. Dark matter isn't an arbitrary fudge factor - we have well-established ways to constrain how dark matter should behave. We aren't changing the laws of physics, which means we are constrained by the classic laws of physics and can't just make stuff up. This means we can do models to test whether the observed gravity could fit with a distribution of dark matter, and what that dark matter particle would have to look like. Additionally, from the particle physics side we're pretty sure we haven't discovered every single type of particle that exists, and there's plenty of room to find more.

But if we're changing the fundamental laws of physics, all bets are off. There's no real constraints here, because you are changing the constraints. So of course you can match the observations, but the problem is that's no real test that your physics are correct. You are basically playing with epicycles here - arbitrarily modifying your model to fit the observations.

So yeah, it's possible gravity may act differently on large scales, but we really need to rule out the simpler and more obvious answer of ""there's more stuff that's slightly different"" before we fundamentally change the laws of physics to fit a couple of oddities. And even then, we really need a lot more evidence before we know which direction to change the laws of physics, rather than basically just arbitrarily inventing stuff that sounds nice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/oy3q4n/why_do_most_scientists_believe_that_dark_matter/

TransientLunatic_,2022-10-24,1.0,"There are many physicists currently attempting to create revised equations of gravity to account for the problems that Dark Matter solves. This approach is called MOND (MOdified Newtonian Dynamics), and as of yet has fallen much shorter of explaining what we see then Dark Matter theories.

Im particular, while MOND can be fine-tuned to predict galaxy rotations, it cant explain our observations of things such as the Bullet Cluster, or any other place where the ratio of concentration of visible to dark matter is different. Or rather, if it is modified to solve these problems, then it no longer accurately reflects the rotation of galaxies. Dark matter, on the other hand, explains these multiple separate observations simultaneously.

In the Bullet Cluster, we see the aftermath of two galaxy clusters colliding. If MOND were correct and not DM, all of the gravitation lensing would be observed around the visible matter. MOND changes how gravity behaves over cosmic distances, but it remains an outwardly radiating force from all mass. However, our observations of gravitational lensing indicate that the centers of mass are not in the same places where all of the visible matter is.

The way these centers of invincible mass seem to have moved since the collision do match the description of dark matter as a particle that interacts only with gravity, however; visible mass clumps up into solar systems and black holes, while dark matter remains diffuse and passes through itself.

Another example is the galaxy NGC-1052-DF2, which appears to lack dark matter; its rotation shows that its total mass is roughly the same as its visible mass, unlike most galaxies which have total masses far above their visible masses. It would be very difficult for a set of MOND equations to explain this, because MOND theories would require galaxies with the same amounts of visible mass to have the same amounts of total mass.

In a similar vein, there are regions of space empty of visible matter that nonetheless exhibit strong gravitational lensing, indicating a high concentration of dark matter. This is also difficult for MOND approaches to explain.

As for the properties of dark matter itself, the most obvious characteristic is that it interacts neither with electromagnetism nor with the nuclear forces. While this might sound far-fetched, we do know of particles that dont interact with these forces already; Neutrinos and Higgs bosons play a role in the weak force, but do not interact with electromagnetism or the strong force (which is why they too can pass through visible matter mostly uninhibited like dark matter is meant to). While neither of these is a suitable dark matter candidate for a variety of reasons, they show how some very non-interactive particles can exist.

Essentially, we have tons of evidence for some kind of weakly interacting massive particle that generates a lot of the gravitational force we see on the largest cosmic scales. When scientists talk about detecting dark matter on Earth, they mean building extremely sensitive instruments to see the infinitesimally tiny gravitational tugs caused by individual dark matter particles passing through patches of visible matter. This is very similar to what we had to do to detect the neutrino, but much more difficult and precise; we used the weak force to detect neutrinos, but are relying on gravity (which is ironically much weaker then the weak force) for dark matter, so the sensitivity must be much higher.

I mean the only way I could possibly engage with this is to point out that the simple fact we cannot detect it proves it's currently undetectable.  It's UFO logic - the fact we can't identify the object means it's unidentified.

It would no longer be undetectable.  And by developing a method of detecting it, we'd probably learn a hell of a lot about what it is.

But we can measure the expansion of the universe and develop a mass of the universe based on changes in rate in expansion, and that math is not off by a factor of fucking 20.

There are two groups of theories that produce the strongest predictive power & most accurately model our universe: Quantum Field Theories and General & Special relativity

Quantum theories arose because of a glaring issue back in the late 19th century, dramatically called the ""Ultraviolet catastrophe"". We had these really great equations for describing blackbody radiation that physically made sense, but when you summed up all of the light emitted by a blackbody, it.. blew up into infinity. Needless to say, blackbodies did not radiate away infinite light

It wasn't until a smart cookie by the name of Max Planck offhandedly quantized the frequency of light (which is also to quantize a photon's energy) (to quantize is to break into discrete chunks; the frequency of light was being treated as a continuum until this point). 

Lo and behold, after tuning the size of these quanta, the equation for blackbody radiation matched ***exactly*** to the real world. This newly tuned quanta has since been proven to physically real - photons ***MUST*** take on integer multiples of this fundamental minimum frequency. There is literally no photon possible that can take on, for example, 2.5 times this smallest energy packet

Gladix,2022-10-14,1.0,">This seems highly unlikely, and seems much more likely that there's just some force or something that we haven't quite figured out.

That's exactly what dark matter is. The way it was discovered is because we couldn't explain the gravitational forces of the parts of the universe that are seemingly ""empty"". Or rather the galaxies are influenced gravitationally by something that we have no way to explain by using the current-day theory of gravity. The edges of huge galactic constellations for example should be traveling slower than those near center, yet they travel at almost the exact same speeds which should be impossible. So we have 2 options:

1, There is something there that we just cannot detect right now. This thing has to consist of some sort of particles that don't interact with visible light in a conventional way.

2, Our theory of gravity is incorrect and/or not all-encompassing and we have to modify it in order to adjust for this anomaly.

Both options have some things going for them. 

The first option (dark matter is real) the influences of ""the alleged"" dark matter are consistent with a cosmological constant which is sort of a mathematical bandaid describing sort of (negative energy) that Einstein hypothesized but discarded later.

And the second option (dark matter is not real, our understanding id flawed) could be true because we do actually have mathematical models of gravity that would adjust for this anomaly.

However, there is observable evidence to support the existence of dark matter (e.g. lensing effects), and dark energy (1a supernovae).

Dark matter did not exist prior to the big bang.

To me, it simply seems just as likely to be that we do not fully understand a fundamental aspect of physics, rather than an undetectable physical matter with mass is floating randomly through our universe. 

  
Dark matter attempts to expain, when we use our currently accepted physics equations, the unexpected gravitation rotations of galaxies. It does so by saying there must be some sort of hidden mass creating extra gravity which is causing these rotational anomolies. 

  
Alternative gravity theories such as MOND (which may or may not be correct, and are likely not fully develped) are saying there is something we do not fully understand with the laws of physics and the universe, and this misunderstanding is causing these rotational anomlies.  


Some people say dark matter is simply a placeholder for what is causing rotational anomalies, but it becomes more of a muddied water as some say there is some sort of physical matter causing these gravitational anomolies. 

  
However, that physical matter has never actuallly been detected, despite millions of dollars in experiments. If you fall in to this category, you are essentially saying an undetectable particle (so far) with mass, causes the gravitational anomolies and our current understanding of general realitivity and gravity formulas are correct. This is the most popular theory, but it is just that. A theory is valid until it is disproven.

budrap00,2022-01-21,2.0,"The only purpose of dark matter is to reconcile the standard model of cosmology with observations. That's it, there is no empirical evidence for the existence DM. This situation exists because of a naive belief that our gravitational models (Newtonian or General Relativity) that were derived in the context of the solar system should work equally well on  vastly larger and more complex systems like galaxies and galaxy clusters. They don't.

All the so-called evidence for DM amounts to its ability to be deployed in any quantity in any location to make the SMoC agree with observations. DM is essentially all purpose gravitational fairy dust.  The reason DM is so good at this is because its properties have been defined down to something that makes the model work without having any bothersome properties that might make it directly detectable. 

DM is like quarks for cosmology, something that has to be there for the model to work but due to its failure to appear in observed reality it has been necessary to assign DM the property of invisibility (transparent to electromagnetic radiation). 

The case of quarks is handled somewhat differently (quark confinement) but the end result is the same, necessary components of the model that can't be empirically demonstrated to exist are simply declared impervious to direct detection. 

That's not science but it is the way academic science rolls these days. The resulting standard models are either inanely simplistic like the Big Bang or baroquely complex like particle physics.

budrap00,2022-01-17,-2.0,"Science does not deal in proof, only in evidence. There is no empirical evidence for the existence of dark matter. It is a free parameter that was added to the standard model of cosmology originally to account for the flat rotation curves of galaxies. Being a free parameter it was found to be useful in any situation where the the math of General Relativity failed to account for observations at galactic scale and beyond.

The mathematical formalism (field equations) of GR was developed in the context of the solar system at a time (1905-1915) when the known extent of the Cosmos was essentially the Milky Way. The GR equations have never worked well at galactic and above scales, but since it was assumed that the math constituted a Universal Law, it was observed reality that was deemed deficient. Dark matter was conceived to correct for one such deficiency.

The problem is that math is not science. Science is the study of those things that can be observed and measured; mathematics is a set of logical formalisms based on counting. Math is a useful and essential tool of science, but it is only a tool; it is not science. 

Modern cosmology has developed into a cult whose practitioners hold the unscientific belief that their mathematical model determines the nature of physical reality when the opposite should be the case - their math should *reflect* the nature of *observed* physical reality.

As a consequence of their unscientific belief in the primacy of mathematical models, proponents of the Big Bang model insist that there exists, not only dark matter, but dark energy, a universal inflation event, expanding space, and a universal framework such that the entirety of the Cosmos - both observed and unobserved - was once upon a time simultaneously compressed into a volume smaller than a gnat's ass.

None of those beliefs are supported by any direct empirical evidence. All of the so-called evidence for those beliefs consists of model-dependent inferences such that the entirety of the model comprises a particularly baroque example of circular reasoning. *The model is correct, therefore all the undetectable objects and events the model requires in order to be correct must exist because the model is correct.* That is unscientific nonsense and modern cosmology is an unscientific mess.

That the Big Bang model is a failure is, in itself, not a scientific disgrace. Science essentially proceeds by trial and error. The problem with the Big Bang model is that despite its obvious and undeniable incongruence with physical reality, it remains the only cosmological model under consideration by cosmologists of the scientific academy. Both research funding and academic publication are controlled by members of the Big Bang cult and no models are permitted that aren't based on the fundamental *expanding universe* premise that underlies the Big Bang fantasy. 

The current situation is a scientific disgrace but nothing will change until the Big Bang cult's stranglehold on research funding and publication is broken. Until that happens modern cosmology will remain a simplistic belief system devoid of any scientific credibility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmology/comments/s4vrx8/is_dark_matter_proven_to_exist_or_is_it_still/

The intergalactic dust is far more massive than the stellar component of the cluster, so without dark matter you would expect the majority of the mass to be in the middle with all the dust. When you compare the location of the dust (using x-ray imaging) to the mass distribution (using gravitational lensing), you find that instead the majority of the mass is where the stellar components are.

> How do you explain the CMB power spectrum and BBN then?

CMB PS: as a surface measurement (last scattering), not a depth measurement (perfectly smooth *volume* at inflation), of the early universe.  As such, third bump can be interpreted in several ways.  One might be primordial but not remnant.

Further conundrums are that it doesn't clump, but it does, but not where we look, but also, not where we are.  It's critical to galaxies, but the more young ones and GCs we find, and the better instruments we use, the more we find them just devoid of the gravitational evidence of any dark matter at all.

Remember, ?CDM is predicated also on homogeneity and isotropy, both of which are challenged by some of the very observations we have supporting DM/DE.

Caucasiafro,2022-05-04,6.0,"A lot of things in the universe behave certain ways based on how heavy they are.

Like a galaxy will spin at a certain rate based on it's mass (I can't remember if it spins faster or slower if it's heavier).

We see how fast those galaxies are spinning and our math comes out wrong.

Now, the reason we don't just go ""well, I guess our equations are just BS"" is that those equations work for like...everything else.

It's entirely possible our understanding of gravity is just completely wrong; but it's just as likely, if not more so, that we just can't see all the matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/tx75k4/eli5what_is_dark_matters/
[deleted],2022-05-04,6.0,"Stars don't move in spiral galaxies as we would expect from all the matter we can observe in the galaxies.  For instance, you would expect that the further out stars are in a galaxy the slower they would orbit around the galaxy as there is more mass towards the centre of the galaxy.  In fact, spiral galaxies have a central bulge of a lot of mass. Instead, you see basically the same orbital velocity no matter how far out the stars are.  This implies that there's some sort of extra mass around the galaxies that keeps the further out stars moving so fast.",https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/tx75k4/eli5what_is_dark_matters/
RhynoD,2022-05-04,4.0,"> Like a galaxy will spin at a certain rate based on it's mass (I can't remember if it spins faster or slower if it's heavier).

Faster. Higher gravity pulls mass inward so it must spin faster to stay in orbit (at the same distance).

Another piece of evidence is gravitational lensing, where gravity from a galaxy will bend light much like a lens. The amount that the light changes path depends on the mass, and what is observed is more lensing than can be accounted for based on the visible matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/tx75k4/eli5what_is_dark_matters/
RhynoD,2022-05-04,5.0,"Specifically why dark matter is called ""dark"" comes from the original theory that the mass that couldn't be accounted for might be coming from literally dark stuff. Stars are *super* visible. Our own sun accounts for 99.8% of mass in our solar system. It stands to reason that if you count all the stars and know how massive they are, you should be able to get a very reasonable approximation of the mass in a galaxy. Since that is *not* the case, the idea was that the extra mass might be from lots of dust and large planets and all that other *not star* matter that is literally too dark to see.

Well, more surveys and better telescopes ruled that out. In fact, as astrophysicists looked harder, they found that there vastly more dark matter than regular matter in the universe. Even being *super* generous about how much *not star* stuff there is, it simply can't be enough to make up for the huge discrepancy. Another ""dark"" idea was black holes of various sizes, but that has been mostly ruled out as well.

So although the name ""dark"" matter stuck, it doesn't have anything to do with visible light - except that we know that whatever it is, it doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force at all (or so weakly that it might as well be not at all), so it *is* literally dark. It seems that whatever dark matter is, it doesn't interact with *any* of the forces other than gravity, and even then it's very weak. The reason it has such a strong impact is that there's just so much of it. So ""dark"" in this context really means ""unknown.""

That concept of ""dark = unknown"" is where the name ""dark energy"" comes from. Dark energy has nothing to do with dark matter (probably) but, like dark matter, no one knows what it actually is, yet, so it is ""dark"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/tx75k4/eli5what_is_dark_matters/

Plasma is observable, yet gravity is not. What if gravity is what is being called dark matter/energy?

Before, a sun's plasma displays heat, light, etc. What if it can be seen as light matter/energy turning into dark matter/energy?

I am not a physicist or scientist, but simply an average person interested in learning a valid interpretation of the black matter/energy concept.

Light matter/energy changes to dark matter/energy and then back to light matter/energy. Maybe that cycle could help explain many of the atrological measurement deviations or inaccuracies. Everything in existence has some form of cyclical explanation to it.

Alternatives to mainstream thoughts on dark matter and dark energy are still published in mainstream journals. There was even a recent paper shared in this very subreddit last week that argued that the expansion of the universe could be a, ""mirage"". 

The problems with papers like those, however, is that they simply do not agree with as many observations as the existing mainstream models. To use a different example: MOND has been dead in the water for years because it reliably cannot account for observations beyond spiral galaxy rotation rates without invoking dark matter.

SpleenBender,2023-02-07,7.0,"Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to make up a significant portion of the total matter content of the universe. It is called ""dark"" because it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, such as light, making it invisible and difficult to detect directly. Despite its elusive nature, its presence is inferred by its gravitational effects on visible matter and the structure of the universe.

The existence of dark matter was proposed to explain certain observations in astrophysics and cosmology that could not be accounted for by the known types of matter, such as stars, galaxies, and gas clouds. These observations include the rotational speeds of galaxies, the motion of galaxy clusters, and the distribution of matter in the universe on large scales.

One of the earliest pieces of evidence for dark matter came from observations of galaxy rotations. Based on the visible matter in galaxies, scientists expected the outer regions to rotate more slowly than the inner regions. However, observations showed that stars and gas in the outer regions were moving just as fast as those in the inner regions. This implied the presence of additional mass in the form of dark matter, providing the extra gravitational pull required to explain the observed rotational speeds.

Scientists have also studied the gravitational lensing effect, which occurs when the gravitational field of a massive object bends and distorts light passing near it. The observed lensing effects indicate the presence of more matter than can be accounted for by visible objects alone, suggesting the presence of dark matter.

The exact nature of dark matter remains unknown. It is often theorized to consist of non-baryonic particles, meaning they are not composed of protons and neutrons like ordinary matter. Various candidates for dark matter particles have been proposed, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions, but so far, none have been directly detected.

Efforts to detect dark matter particles are underway using a variety of methods, including underground detectors, particle accelerators, and astronomical observations. Scientists hope that by studying dark matter, they can gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe and its evolution.",https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/14ojvrl/we_have_never_seen_dark_matter_and_dark_energy/

jimmycorpse,2018-08-03,10.0,"Imagine you have a big pool of water that is completely calm. If a single rain drop hits that pool is causes a [circular ripple](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWFL6.jpg). By looking at how that ripple propagates through the water you can learn about the water. For instance, the pattern of the thicker circles and narrower circles tells us about the phase velocity and group velocity of water waves. Importantly (for the analogy), if you drop this pool of water (making it essentially weightless), you would remove the restoring force that makes the wave propagate and you would see the ripple stationary on the surface of water. 

Now imagine that there isn't just one rain drop, but many rain drops falling on the surface of the water. You drop this pool of water, making it weightless, and you see a messy pattern frozen on the surface caused by the interference of all the water waves with each other. But, if you take all the high points in this mess of water and  superimpose them on top of each other you would get an image that, on average, looks like single a circular ripple of water. You can then do the same analysis you would with a single drop of water to learn about the water itself. 

We do a very similar analysis to find out the composition of the universe. At one point the universe was dense, and all the matter and energy was sloshing around inside an expanding universe. These are called baryon acoustic oscillations. However, at some point the universe cooled and became sparse enough that it stopped sloshing around because it couldn't interact with itself any more. The restoring force for the sloshing was removed, or the ""pool was dropped"". The remnants of this is called the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is analogous to the frozen pattern of raindrops on our weightless pool. 

The CMB is a measure of how much matter there is in a part of the universe. If you take all the hot spots (and cold spots), with lots of matter (and little matter), and superimpose them on top of each other we get a [pattern very similar to the ripples in water](http://inspirehep.net/record/1224727/files/Figs_spots_pol_stacks30.png). By studying the peaks of those patterns we can lean about the type of matter and energy that caused the ripple. In that image the measured data are on the top and the bottom is what we get from the best fit model (LCDM a model with cold dark matter and dark energy) that tells the the numerical values for the normal matter/dark matter/dark energy composition of the universe that you mention in your question.

OmegaNaughtEquals1,2018-08-03,3.0,"There have been some excellent discussions here about the matter side of things, but there is a component you and others aren't talking about: curvature. The curvature of the universe is a very important part of how we calculate the 71.4% figure.

We know^1 the universe has at least three components we can measure (matter, light, and curvature) and one that we can't (Lambda/dark energy). These quantities are related via the Friedman Equation such that

Omega_matter + Omega_light + Omega_Lambda = 1 - Omega_curvature

The three terms on the left can be written as Omega_Naught, so this is often written

Omega_Naught = 1 - Omega_curvature

Today, the energy density in light (via photons) is essentially zero (~1e-5 ), so we'll discount it for now. The total matter density is measured directly from the power spectrum of the CMB and is 28.6% with visible matter only contributing 4.6%- the rest is in dark matter. We have measured the curvature to be 0 to within a few parts in a thousand (from the Planck satellite) and the ESA's Euclid mission will likely affirm this to an even greater precision. That means the above equation reduces to

Omega_Naught = 1

or

Omega_Lambda = 1.0 - 0.286 = 0.714.

Even if Omega_Lambda isn't Einstein's Lambda, it has to be something that accounts for the remaining energy density and causes the acceleration of the universe.

davidwalsh33,2018-08-03,1.0,"Quoting ""we need more matter""
Thanks for the explaination. Something bothers me very much about this assertion, it seems impossible to be true.
Gravity is a pull, it can not push the universe apart. 
The universe is by definition everything there is.
So even if it is dark, the matter that is ""needed"" to accelerate the expansion of all the space in the universe is still contained within the universe itself. 
The dark matter would have to be somehow outside of the universe to pull the universe apart. 
I will acknowlege that perhaps gravity could pull part of the universe apart at a faster rate than other parts  but it defies any logic to me to assert that the entire universe could be pulled apart from within.

Proposed solution

Could we do a version of the acdm where the cosmological constant is 100% of the expansion force and flip the effects of the force gravity to a counterforce? Ie.  say gravity is not pulling the universe apart but rather pushes against the CC. If that works, then you no longer need dark matter. The value of the CC would be instead determined by the equaision.  It would likely have the effect of requiring gravity to be increasing with the rate of expansion but the effect may be so small that we could not measure it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/82rhw8/the_universe_is_said_to_be_around_23_dark_matter/

GreatBigBagOfNope,2018-08-03,5.0,"So this is actually a legitimate idea about a potential end of the universe, called the **False Vacuum**.

The first thing to understand is that things in the universe like being at low energy. That is, in some intuitive sense, why things like falling into gravitational wells, or why springs enjoy being at their preferred length. (Side note: a key component of the energy of a thing is the **potential**. For gravity, far away the potential is about 0, but it lowers and lowers and lowers as you get closer, and objects want to ""fall"" down this hole. How fast they do fall down depends on how fast they were going before, and how steep the slope of the ""hole"" is)

Quantum Field Theory (sorry) is a theory which attempts (quite successfully - as in, it's the most successful theory ever made, even more so than GR) to push bits and bobs of Special Relativity (SR) into Quantum Mechanics (QM). A consequence of QFT is that there exist **fields** that permeate the entire universe, and things that we know of as electrons, photons, quarks, bosons, everything, are **excitations** of these fields. An electron is a little bump in the electron field, and a photon is a little bump in the EM field. Quarks are a lot harder, but they are still bumps in a field.

Because **maths**, the energy density of the field (amount of energy per volume) is a function of the field (you have a location, you plug the *value* of the field into a number cruncher, and you get a number at the end which is an energy density). This energy density *function* has a minimum point, which the fields typically sit at, because things like being at low energy. But, *what if* there is another minimum? Some other value of the field which produces a lower energy density? Thanks to quantum tunnelling, there is a nonzero probability that the field will just find itself able to descend to this new minimum energy density (again, sorry for the geometric metaphors but if you look at the graphs it genuinely looks like things are falling down holes). 

So what happens when the field finds the new minimum? The bits of field that are nearby will find out very quickly, because the information about this new minimum will spread at the speed of light away from the point where it was first 'discovered'. An expanding sphere of influence will grow into the universe, a boundary where within its reach, the laws of physics of the outside have absolutely no say. Every bit of matter, dark matter, energy, dark energy it touches will be consumed, the very rules by which it plays the game of existence changing as it is encompassed by this new region. Experiencing the change is likely to be instantaneous death, as the very rules which cause electrons and protons and neutrons will be fundamentally changed. The fundamental particles that make up the matter of your body will no longer behave the same, or even exist. It's tough to say what would happen in this new vacuum, the only certainty is that you'd be fried by the utterly absurd energies being released at the surface of this new region (as in, Big Bang fried) followed by your constituent matter no longer being supported by their field and just kind of... dissolving or something.

To ease your mind, if a field were to find a new minimum, starting at the centre of our galaxy, it would take 50,000 years to erase the galaxy, 2.5 million years to reach Andromeda, 10 million years to swallow the Local Group, 500 million years to remove the Virgo Supercluster, and of course around 13 billion years to annihilate the universe. Not that we would see it coming, but hey, if it's already started, we've probably got some time left to enjoy it.

Final side note: this is related to Inflation Theory in cosmology, except in that the field in question is a completely new field, with particles called inflatons which may or may not be observable, and in most forms the field has a *time dependant"" component, allowing the energy to be released in both a more global and controlled way.

Nergaal,2018-08-03,8.0,"Dark Matter is relatively easy to understand.  If you look in the Solar System, Mars revolves around the Sun at a distance 1.66 that of Earth.  That means, in one orbit it goes 1.66 the distance Earth does.  But the actual time it takes is 1.88 years instead of 1.66 years.  That is because being farther from the Sun, Mars needs to go SLOWER to stay in its orbit (and not fall into the Sun or fly away).

At a galaxy level though, this is not what is observed.  The equivalent of Mars needs to go faster, and have a 1.66 years orbit instead of 1.88 years. It needs to go faster because there is more mass, and this mass is distributed weirdly (as if there was another part of the Sun somewhere between Earth and Mars).  This mass gives no light and does not seem to interact with regular matter in any way.  This is Dark Matter.

Dark Energy is more along the lines of  /r/blackmagicfuckery.  If you launch a rocket at 60 miles per hour, in 1 hour it would be at 60 miles away from you, in two hours it would be at 120 miles away, and so on.  But when galaxies do this, it goes from 60 miles after 1 hour, to 180 miles away in 2 hours.  Source of this is what we describe as Dark Energy.

The ""180 miles away in 2 hours"" and ""1.66 years orbit instead of 1.88"" gives us the 23% and 72% numbers.  (Actual numbers are not 180 or 1.66, but you get the idea).",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/82rhw8/the_universe_is_said_to_be_around_23_dark_matter/

klesto92,2018-08-03,36.0,"I actually wrote about this during the last bit of my degree in physics. I would link it to you but a) its a bit complicated for non physicists and b) its in spanish. So let me explain it as clear as I can:

As you may or may not know we use General Relativity to study cosmology. The usual model uses the FLRW solution to Einsteins field equations(EFE). This solution is used for a homogeneous and isotropic space-time (that basically means the contento of matter/energy is the same everywhere and in all directions). So the equations that stem from the EFE using this solution do not t fully describe the behavior of space-time, we need something else: A content inside this universe. For this the simplest model to use is a fluid (a perfect fluid, a fluid which has some properties that make it easier to use than a more real fluid). When you look at galaxies in a sufficiently big scale, they can be modeled using a perfect fluid. Now we can work using the EFE and the equation for the fluid to have a description of the evolution of the universe. 

So suppose we have the usual stuff that we know: matter and light (yes, light can be modeled as a fluid). We do a study using these two fluids and... we arrive at the conclusion that the universe is expanding but it is expanding slower every time. But then we have a problem, we observe the universe and we find that the prediction of the model is wrong and the expansion of the universe is accelerating. We need more matter/energy in the universe for this to happen so we take another usual model called: ?CDM (a model with Cosmological Constant (or Dark Energy) and Cold Dark Matter) and we test it and we see that it makes a much better adjustment to the equations. From this we infer that we have around 30% of CDM and 70% of ?.

You might still be wondering how we arrive at these numbers, I havent explained that yet. So now Ill do it.

To perform the studies I roughly mentioned above we use data from a particular type of supernovae: supernovae type Ia. This kind of supernovae emit a pretty standardized amount of light and energy. So the data used is something called distance modulus its some kind of comparison between absolute and apparent magnitudes (the apparent measures the brightness of the object how we perceive it and the other measures how bright it would be at 10 parcecs away from us). This quantity is linked with the distance by a little equation. And the other data needed is the reshift of the object (basically how far away it would be, or how red its light appears to be due to its relative motion from us because of the expanding universe). We have this observational data captured from huge supernovae samplings. And we have the equations that give us a theoretical expression (an expression that has Dark Energy, CDM and redshift as parameters) for the distance modulus. 

Now for getting those numbers we need to make a statistical study if said data. We compare the data with the theoretical input and try to minimize the difference with the observational data of the distance modulus of the supernovae. What we do is we sample a lot of values for Dark Energy and CDM and obtain a range of values using a Markov Chain in the Metropolis-Hastings method (at least thats what I did), obviously we use a computer for this. We input some arbitrary values for DE and CDM we make a comparison between the calculated distance modulus using these values and the observational data then we put some conditions that make the program make the decision if that value is useful or not and if it is it keeps it and if its not it walks a new step (that is it defines a new value for DE and CDM) and once again the program tests if these new values for DE and CDM are useful or not and so on until the program finishes the amount of steps we want it to take. We end up with a bunch of chains made of different values for DE and CDM. We plot some histograms and take the averages and what would you know, the averages are the 30% and 70% you know about. Does that mean thats what the universe is made of? No. In this case the averages are also the values of DE and CDM that are most likely in our universe. 


I hope this helps you understand a bit more on what is actually done in this type of research and I really hope you read my comment because it took me like half an hour or more to write. If you have any questions you can ask me and Ill gladly try to answer them.

Edit: I messed up a bit (not counting all the typos) where I said you need a content for the EFE to be useful. Thats not entirely true, once you have the perfect fluid (in this case) theres still something missing for the equations to be useful, we need more information about the fluid: the Equation of State. Its a relation between several thermodynamical properties but in the case of a simple fluid used in cosmology we only need an equation that relates the pressure of the fluid p and its energy density ?

There are a couple of ways we think we know how DM is distributed. The first is through the direct observations we can make in the universe of the gravitational effects. The presence of matter and thus gravity naturally effects how things move or rotate, and how fast; so from the scale of stars to galaxies to groups and clusters of galaxies, we can build up a working picture, combined with gravitational lensing that sometimes gives us a very accurate measure. The second is from simulations - there is a big industry in cosmology building big simulations of the evolution of matter on enormous scales over billions of years, and from this we can get a decent picture of how [matter on large scales](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/the-beautiful-complexity-of-the-cosmic-web/) ends up at the present day.  

As for how uniform it is, well we know it's in spherical clumps (we call them halos since they surround galaxies and clusters); we have some [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro%E2%80%93Frenk%E2%80%93White_profile) derived from observation that describe how they get denser towards the middle and more tenuous at the edges. We also know these clumps draw together and merge over the history of the universe.

*Edited to add:* Where is it - yes, our galaxy like all others sits in a dark matter halo, and most of the matter in the universe is dark matter, so finding some would seem to be easy. As for whether we could we study a particle - we have a few ideas and experiments trying to detect whether they interact with normal matter even a tiny bit, but so far finding a way to actually study one and figure out its properties eludes us.

But overall in the universe, our estimate comes from the scale of the fluctuations of energy density in the early universe.  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is radiation left over from the period in the universe when the temperature finally fell just enough for electrons to join with nucleons to become atoms, and with no more free charged particles, photons became free to travel in the universe.  What we can do is look at the CMB radiation and map the scale of energy fluctuations over very large scales in the early universe.  There were several forces at play determining the shape of these fluctuations.  Gravitation tried to pull things together, whereas radiation pressure pushed things apart, and the curvature of the universe played a role.  If you plot the angular power spectrum of the CMB, as a functino of the multipole moment, you get a multi humped shape, and these humps gives us information about the shape of the universe (essentially flat, which gives us information about dark energy) and the ratio of matter not experiencing pressure (dark matter) to regular matter.

Aeellron,2018-08-03,12.0,"Basically from gravitational equations.

The famous 'discovery' of dark matter is from astronomers measuring the rotational velocities of stars in a galaxy. 

When you look at planets orbiting the sun the inner planets orbit much faster than the outer planets. We expected to measure the same kind of difference in speeds of stars in a disc galaxy (like our own). We did not.

Instead they found that the outer stars are basically going the same speed as the inner stars. Almost like the entire visible galaxy was actually set in an invisible sphere and the spheres' rotational velocity was essentially the rotational velocity for the entire system. (Think about one of those cool hand-blown glass marbles and how the designs inside all rotate around the center at the same rate).

The only solutions, mathematically, that fit the observed data are: our formula for gravity is wrong (it might be, but it's far too predictively accurate to be off by enough to account for these observations) or, there's a whole lot more mass than we can see in the system.

By 'can't see' scientists basically mean 'non-interacting' with other matter. So they crunch the numbers to figure out how much mass the dark matter is compared to normal matter (x% normal matter + y% dark matter = z rotational velocity). This is where the percentages come in and therein is the answer to your question.

Dark energy is a little different but also kind of similar. Instead of using gravitational measurements we made velocity measurements of red-shift (talking about the expansion of spacetime  with respect to entropy) and found our x% normal energies did not equal the z velocities that we observe. Again, crunch some numbers and solve for the unknown y% dark energy and bam.

There are a couple good documentaries on the idea around. YouTube has several good explanatory videos as well. I would recommend PBS Space Time, the host is a little cheesy but very informative.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/82rhw8/the_universe_is_said_to_be_around_23_dark_matter/

ps311,2018-08-03,127.0,"For dark matter and ordinary matter, we basically measure the *total* matter first (since it all gravitates the same), then differentiate between the two using a second effect. 

The total matter (23%+5%=28%) is roughly given by the ratio of heights of the first and third peaks in the [Cosmic Microwave Background angular powerspectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#/media/File:PowerSpectrumExt.svg) because the third peak mostly evolved (by gravity) when the matter content of the universe was negligible, and the first peak mostly evolved when the universe was matter dominated. So the third peak is kind of a calibrator letting the first peak tells you how much matter there is.

To differentiate just the ""ordinary matter"" part, you can get that from the CMB too, but an even cooler way is by measuring how much of various atomic elements there are in the universe in little pockets that appear to have been pristinely left from the Big Bang. In these pockets, you see that something like 24% of the atoms are Helium-4. The amount of Helium-4 formed by the Big Bang depends really sensitively on how much ordinary matter there was, i.e. the ordinary atoms that are the building blocks of Helium. Run the math and that 24% number tells you about 5% of the universe is normal matter. Then 28%-5% and you get the part which is ""missing"", i.e. dark matter. 

As for dark energy, well we've just measured how much matter there is (I actually cheated a bit above, those things tells you the total amount of matter, not the percentage relative to everything), so we can calculate how much all that matter gravitating in on itself should slow the expansion of the universe. Then you go and measure the expansion and find, lo-and-behold, not only is the expansion not slowing, its accelerating! Using supernovae as beacons to precisely measure the acceleration rate, you work out how much dark energy there is, giving you that 72% number.

There's probably like 10 other ways to measure these things than what I just described, cosmologists are constantly looking for new ways to do so and comparing the answers against each other, in hope to find a crack in the model pointing to some new things we don't understand!

We knew that the universe is expanding, bit it seems like the RATE at which it's expanding was itself increasing. What's causing this acceleration? There has to be some energy that we can't see. But it's got nothing to do with the gravity or the warping of space time.

There was some talk that the observations which demonstrated an accelerating exclamation couldn't be replicated with better equipment, and may have even been an error on a single study.

CyberneticPanda,2018-08-03,29.0,"It's almost certainly not one single thing. There are weakly interacting particles that were once thought to be massless and now believed to have mass like [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino). Part of the mass that we can't find is neutrinos, because they are very difficult to detect. There have been simulations where the missing mass is all neutrinos, but they don't match with what we see in the real world, so neutrinos can't be the only explanation. Small dark bodies like asteroids could be an explanation for part of it too, but again, simulations that have the entire amount of missing mass made of small cold rocks don't match observations, plus the extra mass doesn't seem to be concentrated in the galactic disk, like rocky material orbiting the galaxy would be expected to do. 

So ""dark matter"" is sort of a catchall term for all of the stuff contributing to gravity that we have not yet identified, and the amount of it required means that some of it is likely to be some sort of exotic matter that we haven't seen yet, since simulations using stuff we have seen don't fit observations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/82rhw8/the_universe_is_said_to_be_around_23_dark_matter/

blueg3,2018-08-03,40.0,"No. The luminiferous aether was how we imagined light transmitted through free space, because we imagined that it worked the same as other waves (transmission of a perturbation of a medium, so you need a medium). It was a theory that was based on how similar things work, but didn't have experimental evidence.

Dark matter is almost the opposite. We have a theory of gravity. We have observations based on that theory of gravity. There is a disparity between those observations that is not accounted for by what we know about. So we give that disparity a name. ""Dark matter"" is the name given to a gap in our theoretical models that we know about because of experimental observations.

PLTuck,2018-08-03,39.0,"Ah I see.

OK so to calculate the total mass in the Milky Way, we use a formula called the galactic rotation curve which allows the enclosed mass inside any distance in parsecs to be calculated.

The equation is actually quite simple ,and is based on Newtons 2nd Law of motion, and Newton's law of gravitation.

M = ( v^2 R)/G

M = mass,
v=orbital speed,
R=radius, and 
G=universal gravitational constant (6.673x10^26 N m^2 kg^-2 )

By plotting these rotation curves for various distances on a logarithmic scale graph, we can see that a considerable amount of matter actually extends out beyond the visible galactic disc. The only thing is, we haven't observed it, at any wavelength.

TotallyRealDev,2022-12-12,3.0,"So from my understanding (Which almost definetly is wrong) is that there are two real possibilites.

A) The Universe is a infinate 'flat' plane that goes on forever

B) Is 'curved' and it would be like traversing around the surface of a sphere.

Currently we have no way of knowing but our limited measurments lean closer to a flat plane than curved space time.

The next thing to consider is that what are currently seeing around us is but an infinitesimal small snippit of the universe as a whole. That's why we always refere to it as the observable universe.

Now when we are viewing the edge of the universe we are also looking back in time. If you were to somehow instantly teleport to the furthest possible point that we could see then you would be in a sense also time traveling 14.5 billion years.

With our current understanding of physics we predict that things would look more or less the same as they do here in our local cluster. It then wouldn't be too much of a strech to assume that things would look the same beyond that barrier that is the observable universe.

Also things start to get really weird when it comes to causality and multi-billion lightyears of seperating.

>The three clues we mentioned in the Introduction, i.e., the dominance of black holes in the entropy inventory, the CMB spectrum and the holographic entropy maximum all hint at PBHs as the dark matter constituents.

pm_me_ur_hamiltonian,2017-03-17,1.0,"General relativity says that the expansion of space is driven by the density of its contents. And when the scale of space changes, so does the density of its contents as a result. Now, **the density of matter and the density of dark energy have two different responses when the scale of space changes, and because of that, they have two different effects on the rate of expansion**. If the volume of a region doubles, the density of matter in that region is halved. On the other hand, dark energy does not lose density even while space is expanding. When space expands, new dark energy appears and fills it. Because of these two different responses, a universe will expand differently depending on the ratio of matter and dark energy in that universe. This is observed by surveying distant galaxies.

That yields the total amount of matter in the universe, both dark and atomic. So how do scientists distinguish between dark and atomic matter? There are many methods. One is to measure the variance of local densities in the universe. Atomic matter emits light, loses energy, and falls down into galaxies. Dark matter does not emit light, retains energy, and does not collapse to the same degree as atomic matter. This has a large effect on how galaxies form and change over time. If the ratio of dark matter and atomic matter were different, galaxies would look different.",https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5zore3/eli5_the_calculation_which_dictates_the_universe/
Space_Jellyfish,2017-03-17,2.0,"> No mass occlusions of bright bodies, nothing to point to as a clump in the sky and say 'there is your dark matter'.

Dark matter can only interact with normal matter through gravity out of all the 4 forces, which means it can't interact through EM waves (light). Therefore it literally can't block/reflect/absorb light. All light would just pass through it like it's not there. 

>can you really tell me that 'we can't find it' is a satisfactory answer? Why are we not re-examining our model instead?

That is the current best theory that the majority believe should be the case, based on all current observations. Others have formulated their own theories to explain gravity AND include the 'dark matter' data discrepancy. However, a theory of gravity must be able to match all data in every other phenomenon, not just galaxy's rotation. So far, no theories have been more successful in doing that than Einstein's GR, and all of them would require much more unproven assumptions to be made. So the best model we now have is GR + dark matter.

[deleted],2017-03-17,1.0,"You're saying dark matter helps link galaxies into gravitational relationships, and it is decaying in some way causing an acceleration of the escape velocity of every galaxy from themselves? I think this isn't quite right, because we've observed galaxy collisions and from what I remember, the interstellar dust and gas within each galaxy ends up stopping in place as if it were glued to something while the stars of the galaxy fly on through with the cores, and that sticky trap ended up being dark matter from each of the galaxies holding the small debris in place. If it were associated with inter-galactic behavior, then it stands to reason we would see more tracts of inter-galactic dust and debris that is pulled along in rivers/channels between relatively close galaxies.

I think the best bet for explaining away dark energy would be to toy with escape velocities and coriolis effects, say once so much mass has drifted past a certain horizon then the inter-galactic center of mass is redistributed to a perpendicular vector relative to the former center-of-mass escape vector, allowing its acceleration to the future center of mass to equally accelerate from all other relatively equally distant points. Then all you would need is to properly define dark matter and our models would solidly predict pretty much every spatial attribute we can measure and observe.

I wouldn't think too much on it though, it's highly unlikely that a theory like this hasn't been completely explored and that's why we're still calling those forces what they are for the moment.

As for the coriolis effect i mentioned, look at the top gif on the wikipedia for it and imagine the ""down"" vector as being center of mass, aside from the initial approach of the ball to the red dot, it looks very much like an acceleration as it nears the edge.

It could be a tiny force that dark matter takes advantage of in the way i described changing the center of mass and wide scale orbital characteristics, making its effect look more drastic than it is, usurping the power that dark matter presents in the universe by hiding it in a lesser force.

My personal opinion is that neutrinos are virtual mass particles that decay once their out of a certain level of gravitational field density, basically creating moments of virtual gravity on the outer bands of any given galactic disk. Since stars give off neutrinos, this correlates nicely with the mass of the galaxy, possibly even how galactic disks form since all of the mass of the galactic disk could withstand a strong pulse of gravity but outside the disk, the isolated clusters of mass wouldn't be able to mitigate the energy and over long periods, be either demolished or assimilated into the disk where the gravitational foundation is more stable. This would mean dark energy and dark matter are simplifications of the microcosm onto the larger orders of the universe.

Scottacki,2017-03-16,15.0,"As far as my knowledge goes, I don't think expansion of space is caused by a traditional definition of force, but don't take that as absolute truth, I just don't know personally.
As far as Einstein's cosmological constant goes, that's an interesting story. At the time, it was a widely held belief that the universe was static. It was this size, always had been, always will be. So when the equations that fell out of Einstein's general theory of relativity suggested that the universe was not static, but expanding, he thought he had done something wrong. He added the cosmological constant to ""fix"" his equations to force them to produce a static universe. 
It's kinda hard to believe how one of the greatest physicists of all time was so closed minded about the possibility of a widely accepted theory being wrong and to even go as far as to add a constant into an equation for no reason other than to make it fit with this.
Anyway, when it became apparent that the universe WAS expanding, Einstein abandoned his cosmological constant, even reportedly calling it the ""biggest blunder of his life.""
Now, the cosmological constant is being used to explain the force seemingly counteracting gravity, dark energy.
So, Einstein was essentially accidentally correct. He added a constant for entirely the wrong reason, only to have it help explain dark energy further down the line. The question now is the value of the cosmological constant since this will tell us the ""shape"" of the universe, whether it is flat, spherical or hyperbolic (like a Pringle) pretty much determines the future of the universe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5zore3/eli5_the_calculation_which_dictates_the_universe/

[deleted],2017-03-16,39.0,"I want to make some general comments to reply to a whole host of lower-rated comments that are dominating the discussion down here below the actual answers.

""Dark matter"" really literally does mean *matter* that is *dark.* It is not simply a placeholder name or a vague metaphor. It could actually be as simple as huge masses of unassociated planet- or star- like objects drifting out there in the void between galaxies where it's *literally too dark* to see them. This (MACHOs) is a somewhat unlikely theory, but can't be ruled out. The leading theory (WIMPs) is that much of the substance of the universe is taken up in particles that bear mass, and so interact gravitationally with baryonic matter, but are electromagnetically inert. Many of you will be aware that literally trillions of [neutrinos](http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~larson/Webpage/neutrinos.html) pass through each of our bodies every second; these theoretical WIMPs would be very much like neutrinos, except slower moving so that they can hang around in clumps around galaxies instead of flying along out of all but the very strongest gravity wells. (One of the strongest candidate theoretical particles for dark matter is actually called the [neutralino.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralino))

There is this ongoing meme that ""dark matter"" is just a modern [*virtus dormitiva,*](http://everything2.com/title/Dormitive+virtue) an impressive but vacuous label pasted over a lack of understanding. **This is false.** We have specific theoretical and observational reasons to believe that dark matter *is matter that is dark,* not some quirk of gravitational law:

* Our current laws of gravity are not just empirically curve-fitted to match observations. They ""fall out"" inevitably once certain very high-level and abstract assumptions about the nature of space-time are made. No-one has proposed any alternative theory that matches observations at least as well as Einsteinian general relativity while also having this property of ""looking like"" a legitimate fundamental theory. They're all just kludges. We seem far more entitled to add ""kludges"" to our inherently limited and incomplete telescopic observations of that portion of the universe which is visible to us in the electromagnetic spectrum than we do to add kludges to fundamental, abstract physical laws.

* We have at least some direct observational evidence that refutes non-dark-matter explanations of the anomaly in galaxy rotation rates. The [Bullet Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster#Significance_to_dark_matter) is a galactic collision that has caused stars and galaxies to spatter out in all directions in a pattern that looks *exactly* as if the galaxies' dark matter halos are really there and interacting gravitationally, and that seems to be *impossible* to explain without invoking such halos of dark matter. Since the 2006 Bullet Cluster observations there have been several other similar collisions observed. Admittedly, the interpretation of these observations is complex, and diehard opponents of the dark matter theory have attempted to poke holes in them. You really need to be an actual cosmologist to judge the resulting debates independently, but it is clear that almost everyone in the field thinks they really do refute non-dark-matter theories.

* We don't have to do any kind of violence to the [standard model of particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) to make room for WIMPs. There are actually several different places in the model where we can plausibly fit candidate particles that have the necessary properties to be dark matter. It is true that the experimentalists have started to eliminate some of these candidates, including [one that seemed almost ""miraculously"" plausible,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) but there is still a lot of room in the model.

In the case of the way that galaxies move away from each other, the equations (that again, we know work in nearly every other situation) only work if there is a whole bunch of extra energy. But since we don't detect or know of another source for that energy, we call it ""dark"" as well. 

Astrophysicists use ""dark"" in the same way a mathematician might use ""X"". It's a place holder for an unknown value.

It is possible that our equations are just wrong, but there is so much experimental evidence backing them up, scientists feel that it is FAR more likely that we simply don't know how to detect this ""dark"" stuff that's thousands or millions of light years away.

There has been at least one recent paper published which redefines gravity as not curvature of spacetime but rather an emergent phenomenon of information in spacetime. According to this new theory, our observations of galaxies matches the math, and there is no need to invent placeholder names to explain away massive differences between our math and our observations.

There's probably virtually no dark matter in Earth (even assuming ""cold dark matter"" which is the popular hypothesis), because it doesn't interact electromagnetically. It will generally interact through gravity, which is an extremely weak force, and earth just doesn't have that big of a gravity well.

In the sub-atomic realm I believe (not sure as I don't math that hard yet) while we didn't initially expect unique interactions we can predict and now prove them with new mathematical models. What's interesting is on the sub-atomic level it's easier to figure out because everything larger works differently right? There's a line between atomic and sub-atomic interactions.  

If things work differently with no fine line on the massive side it becomes increasingly difficult to hypothesize when, how, and why the change from Einsteinian physics occur. We can't discount it and frankly it would be incredible if true, but if I understand the problem correctly it would be very very difficult to prove mathematically vs using dark matter that fits nearly into our current models.

bharder,2023-07-21,9.0,"Layman understanding:

The name ""dark matter"" just means matter that doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force, or interacts so rarely that it's almost impossible to observe. It's mass in galaxies that we can't see in observations, but we can see in the gravitational effects.

Neutrinos are an example of a dark matter, but they move too fast, and are not abundant enough to account for the gravitational effects we observe.

The [Bullet Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster) is probably the most visually satisfying proof that there is ""dark matter"".

Two galaxy clusters collided. In the collision, the majority of the visible matter (in pink) separated from the ""dark matter"", which we can't see directly, but we know is there because of gravitational lensing (in blue-ish-purple).

> The stars of the galaxies, observable in visible light, were not greatly affected by the collision, and most passed right through, gravitationally slowed but not otherwise altered.

> The hot gas of the two colliding components, seen in X-rays, represents most of the baryonic, or ""ordinary"", matter in the cluster pair. The gases of the Intracluster medium interact electromagnetically, causing the gases of both clusters to slow much more than the stars.

> The third component, the dark matter, was detected indirectly by the gravitational lensing of background objects.

Looking at the [image](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0808/bullet_cluster_c60w.jpg), (pink) is where the majority of the visible matter is located, but (blue-ish-purple) is where we see gravitational lensing.

friendtoalldogs0,2023-07-21,5.0,"I think the idea is that in the modern universe, everything (including dark matter) has a bunch of angular momentum, so without something like friction to bleed off that momentum, dark matter will form a big puffed up cloud of stable, circular orbits, keeping most of the mass well away from the center. But, in the very early universe, there were large systems of matter and dark matter without much angular momentum, so they could collapse more or less in a straight line toward their shared center of gravity, which would result in highly elliptical orbits with much of the mass passing through the same point, potentially allowing dark matter to reach a high enough density to form a black hole",https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/154zpmx/jwst_might_have_spotted_the_first_dark_matter/

""Dark Matter"" is a variable that is always equal to the exact difference between the left and right side of equations.

For example: 

Pre-dark matter ---- 4+2+8= 36 

Uh oh... that's no good. Wait, I got it!

Post-dark matter ---- 4+2+8+(22)=36

There. Do you see that 22 up there? That's dark matter and that's all it does. It's a ridiculous concept to adhere to without significantly more evidence. The math didn't work out so they just added in the exact value needed to balance the equation and called it dark matter. Then, to cover their bases and further establish its credibility they decided to go with ""its magic"" to alleviate skepticism. 

So.... let me get this straight here. We're settled on ""it doesn't interact with light or normal matter aside from Mathematically in cosmic scale gravitaty calculations and not even all of those, just some""? That's where the smart money lies?

As I understand it:  by having a different value for the constant a_0 that MOND introduces.  The value of a_0 must be determined by experiment and sets the scale at which gravitational behavior diverges from GR's predictions and begins to behave in the MOND-unique manner.

A major problem for MOND seems to be that using different galaxies to fix the value of a_0 results in different values that are needed for different galaxies.  Proponents of MOND often argue that needing to fix the amount of dark matter in a galaxy is a problem for dark matter models, but in dark matter models it is expected that the dark matter content of galaxies is variable and fits a statistical distribution (which means outliers are expected).  However, needing different values of a_0 for each galaxy not only fails to improve the situation (as you still need a parameter for each galaxy) but arguably makes the situation worse, as a_0 is supposed to be a universal constant yet observations suggest that it cannot be.  So that then demands explanation and as far as I am aware MOND proponents have yet to come up with a satisfactory one.

Alternatively, it's worth considering whether thermalization processes via electro-weak interactions in the early universe should have given any slow-moving neutrinos in the early universe more energy.

No. You make a hypothesis and *you* take the lead in learning and trying to prove it wrong. You can't just turn up and demand proof from others when you're suggesting a new idea in each comment (and without any math to actually be precise about what you're proposing).

FYI, the scientific content of your questions are reasonable. Your tone is sometimes ok, but sometimes not. Asking a question like ""can you show me why this is"" is fine, but saying just ""prove it"" or ""why not?"" is considered rude in English.

As others have said, sterile neutrinos **are** a possible dark matter candidate. However no experiment so far has shown repeatable evidence for their existence, nor ruled them out (if they interact via the weak force, we would see that; that's what the experiments are designed for); so at the moment they're roughly as likely as any other dark matter candidate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_neutrino#Detection_attempts, https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/9650/sterile-neutrinos-as-dark-matter?rq=1, etc. Of course neutrino detection in general is quite difficult, let alone a hypothetical sterile neutrino, so most of these measurements have quite large error bars. Standard neutrinos are not a good candidate by themselves because standard-neutrino-detection experiments measure roughly the amount we expect *without* accounting for dark matter.

In general, dark matter candidates which do interact via the weak force are known as WIMPs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particle).

eldahaiya,2022-03-12,13.0,"u/MaoGo is right: there are only so many neutrinos you can pack inside galaxies due to the Pauli exclusion principle, and that number of neutrinos would be too little to account for all of dark matter in our galaxy. This is known as the Tremaine Gunn bound ([https://theoretical-physics-digest.fandom.com/wiki/Tremaine\_Gunn\_Bound](https://theoretical-physics-digest.fandom.com/wiki/Tremaine_Gunn_Bound)), and a careful study of it using the smallest dark matter structures we know of says that if dark matter is made up of fermions, it has to have a mass of at least a keV or so. Neutrinos are definitely lighter than 1 eV, so they're out as dark matter, from this fact alone.

u/slashdave also points out another problem: how do you produce slow neutrinos in the early universe? Every neutrino has to be thermally coupled to the Standard Model at high enough temperatures (because interaction rates with electrons/protons/neutrons just become too high, it's unavoidable), and we know that the thermally coupled neutrinos are too fast to be the dark matter. You would have to cook up a way of producing neutrinos out of equilibrium temperatures below an MeV, without messing up Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and get the dark matter to appear in time for the CMB. This is very difficult, and will be very baroque. Anyway, point (1) kills you outright.

Neutrinos do have lots of attractive properties to be dark matter though, which is why keV scale sterile neutrinos are a popular candidate of dark matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/zarm5u/why_cant_dark_matter_simply_be_slow_neutrinos/

legsylexi,2022-03-12,2.0,"Neutrinos were actually one of the big initial candidates for dark matter, because of the fact they are so weakly interacting!

However, there is an issue. We know how much dark matter there should be - this is known as the dark matter relic density, and it's 0.12 - and we can work out how what neutrinos would give for this relic density based on their interaction with other Standard Model particles, and their behaviour in the early universe. The neutrino relic density is the sum of the mass of the active neutrinos divided by 100 eV. This means in order for neutrinos to make up all of dark matter they must have a total summed mass of around 12 eV.

HOWEVER, there is another bound, called the Tremaine-Gunn bound, that tells us how heavy fermionic dark matter must be in order for the structure formation we see to occur. This bound says that fermionic dark matter must be AT LEAST 120 eV or heavier in order to create the universe we see today. 

Hence, neutrinos can't be dark matter, because the relic density requires them to have a mass of around on 12eV in order for them to be the dark matter component (any more than this and there would be too much dark matter), but the Tremaine-Gunn bound says that fermionic dark matter MUST be at least 120 eV (you can have lighter dark matter, it just can't be fermionic).

Equally valid is an extremely strong claim though, and I don't think it holds up. And that's specifically because of the part that you think makes your idea more palatable: we already know quite a lot more about neutrinos. We've already walked a lot more of the solution space around them than we can possibly have walked around an unknown particle.

We have maps of the energies that neutrinos can possibly have, we know that there are 3 generations and how they associate with other leptons and how they interact and we know about their interaction cross sections and chirality and their strange relationship with mass. We know way more about them, so there are entire parts of the ""is it neutrinos?"" configuration space that we know we can cross off.

We also don't know if it's a bunch of stray cats flying around space, right? Except we do know a fair amount about cats, and what we do know pretty well rules them out. Maybe there's a whole unknown cat-production process out there in space, sure. If you demanded that I prove that it's *not* space-felines, I'd find that pretty hard. It's an option, but the data we have makes it a lot less likely.

We don't know any of that about dark matter, or at least a lot less of it. We don't know if it interacts weakly but we do know that it doesn't interact electromagnetically. We don't know if it's [a lot of small particles or a small number of big ones](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~george/ay20/eaa-wimps-machos.pdf).

And they're not independent of each other, either -- the properties of the various known particles are dependent on each other through a web of interlinked predictions and measurements. 

The existence of such a new process acting only on known particles, that was likely enough to account for what you want it to account for, would have consequences not just for neutrinos but for other things in the Standard Model as well. For example, the width of the mass distribution of observed Z-bosons, something we can measure with decent precision, tells us something about how many neutrino flavors there are. And so far, there have been no discrepancies between the predictions of the Standard Model and experimental observations that are strong enough to suggest any kind of discovery.

Every dark matter detector looking for this has failed to detect any collisions.  We have no evidence that any force besides gravity mediates dark matter and normal matter.  Without a meditating force, there can be no collision. If you assume dark matter is super-symetric counterpoint, assume R-Parity and that you have a light stable particle, and that it does interact by the weak force you can say a lot about what it would do.  We have zero evidence for dark matter interacting via the weak force.

There is a massive assumption in your first listed paper.
""If DM consists of
WIMPs, they can be gravitationally captured by the Sun""

We have no evidence dark matter are WIMPs.  If they are then they have been experimetnally constrained to an incredibly small cross section and mass by experiments like Icecube and LUX. 

""The sun/planets are massive bodies that can slow down dark matter particles and trap them gravitationnaly. ""
I disagree this has been established to any degree.  There is no evidence of this.

Your attached article from the 80s is calculating assuming that dark matter are neutralinos, and assumes the higgs mass is less than 30GeV.

1. This is a very wrong assumption about the higgs mass.
2.  This assumes low energy super-symetry, which has been ruled out.

WIPS as dark matter is incredibly constrained by experiment.  If the question was ""If dark matter consists of WIMPs would it accumulate at the center of stars?"" then my answer would have been different.

We do consider possible dark sector particles, other particles that could be dark matter that might not interact with standard model particles except through certain processes. but no, just because dark matter clumps doesnt mean its necessarily forming some type of nucleus with electrons like youre thinking, I think you are trying to assume to much ordinary behavior of it.

forte2718,2020-01-23,2.0,">is it more likely the dark matter is actually something physical or some artifact of our poor understanding of gravity?

The consensus is that dark matter is exactly what it is called:  matter, which is physical.  That is why dark matter is a part of the standard model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model (the ""CDM"" stands for ""cold dark matter"").

The truth is that we understand gravity exceptionally well across more than 30 orders of magnitude of experimentally-testable behavior, and every attempt to modify gravity to both account for dark matter and still explain all of the other observational evidence has met with failure -- and not for a lack of trying.  It is possible to modify the laws of gravity on large scales to fit *some* categories of observations, such as galaxies' rotation curves, but there are other categories of observations that modifying gravity seems to be completely incapable of explaining, such as the CMB power spectrum, gravitational lensing observations of collided galaxy clusters (which show a separation of the center-of-gravity and the center-of-baryonic-mass), rates of structure formation in the early universe, and more.  And to even fit things like galactic rotation curves, modified gravity models end up looking very ad hoc and finely-tuned, with different parameters for each galaxy that have to be fixed by observation and cannot be derived from first principles as a prediction, which is very unsatisfying.

Consequently, there is not a single model of modified gravity which is even viable.  Every model of modified gravity that has ever been proposed (and there have been quite a lot of them, studied in great detail) is demonstrably wrong.  Meanwhile, dark matter-based models are exceptionally simple (you literally just add dark matter with one parameter -- the mass density -- and that's it), and they fit *all* of the observations surprisingly well.

Here's a good example more or less explaining the status quo:  [Why the universe needs dark matter (and not MOND) in one graph](https://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/01/18/why-the-universe-needs-dark-matter-and-not-mond-in-one-graph).

Yes dark matter doesn't interact electromagnetically, however direct collisions with the nucleus of an atom can occur so long as the candidate particle interacts via the weak force. This is the basis of many dark matter detectors, collisions with atomic nuclei release energy as a photon and this can be detected if you're particularly clever (and guess the correct particle mass).  Admittedly, the only claimed detections of such particles that I know of were from the DAMA NaI detectors at LNGS and these are highly controversial.

I did some theoretical work for a similar project called SABRE, and as part of it attended a workshop in which this exact possibility was discussed with regards to the sun. I can't recall how it worked, this was several years ago now, but there was the possibility of using this to detect dark matter. It should be noted that even with high densities, due to the vast space between nuclei, these collisions are very rare, and the accretion is going to be slow. For something like the sun, we have relative velocities ranging from ~200-700m/s iirc so it's going to take a fair bit to slow down a particle enough to become trapped within a body like the sun.

forte2718,2020-01-22,201.0,"Well, sort of.

Dark matter should indeed tend to be a little denser at massive bodies such as stars.  However, it would only be *very, very* slightly denser because it interacts so weakly with regular matter (and with itself), there is no possibility for ""accretion"" because nothing will slow it down when it reaches the center of a massive body.  If it comes in towards a massive body with almost any momentum at all, it will pass right through the body and then leave the body with roughly the same momentum.  It will do this over and over again, with its kinetic energy being exchanged for gravitational potential energy and then vice versa again, with nothing to damp these oscillations and no way to permanently lose that kinetic energy because there is no ""friction"" to slow it down and keep it there near the center of the star.  Ordinary matter only accretes into stars because it interacts electromagnetically, so it all ""bumps into"" itself at a star, slowing it down, converting the kinetic energy into thermal energy.

So, only the very slowest of dark matter particles should accumulate inside stars and other massive bodies.  And perhaps, if dark matter does interact very, very rarely and weakly, there *might* be a very slight friction helping dark matter to accrete a little bit.  But it can only be a very small amount.  We're talking like, the density of dark matter within a star would only be on the order of 1% denser than its density in interstellar space.  Not enough to make any significant difference on the scale of solar system dynamics.  It is only relevant for galaxies and larger structures like galaxy groups.

Any significant additional interactions would have a noticable effect on its large-scale distribution, which is why we are confident that there are no additional significant interactions.  It is always possible that there are some very weak interactions such as the short-ranged weak force, and there are numerous experiments looking for weak-mediated annihilation signatures of dark matter for example, but none have been detected to date.

We know dark matter doesn't have any other major interactions besides gravity, so something like a dark star, dark planet, etc. is impossible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/esaqzr/if_dark_matter_does_not_interact_with_normal/
forte2718,2020-01-22,5.0,"Right, so like I said before, gravitational waves are exceptionally weak, they carry very little energy except for the most extreme ones due to binary black holes and neutron stars, and even then most of the energy carried by extreme gravitational waves comes from their mutual gravitational potential energy, which is very significant for such massive bodies.  For a single particle the energy is completely negligible.  Even for something the size and density of the Earth, the Earth loses energy in the form of gravitational radiation due to its orbit of the Sun but it'll take many times the age of the universe before the Earth even loses enough energy that way to reach a distance of Venus' average orbital distance.

The fraction of energy lost due to gravitational radiation might be roughly the same ... but it's still an absolutely insignificant fraction that we're talking about here.  The timescale is so long that it's just not relevant to current-day dark matter distributions.  It will be relevant in the far future when we're talking millions of times the age of the universe, but it's not relevant today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/esaqzr/if_dark_matter_does_not_interact_with_normal/
CluckeryDuckery,2020-01-22,13.0," Well, the current estimate is that baryonic matter, everything we can see. All stars, galaxies, all ""normal"" matter and energy, accounts for about 4% of what's actually in the observable universe. Of what's left, dark matter is thought to be roughly 30% and dark energy to be the remaining 66%.

It's important to note here that dark energy and dark matter have ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with one another. The term ""dark"" is just a place holder until we know what they are. They are not related in any way. We know they both exist, we can see the evidence existence as clearly as we can see leaves rustle in the wind. Dark matter is much less of a mystery than dark energy.

Edit: when i say we know they both exist, that's a poor choice of words. We have strong evidence indicating the existence of both phenomena. And since we don't actually claim to know what each phenomena is, only what we can observe it doing, it a tricky idea to express.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/esaqzr/if_dark_matter_does_not_interact_with_normal/

forte2718,2020-01-22,1.0,">I'm imagining a atomic-scale version of dynamical friction.

The large-scale behavior of dark matter is statistical and dynamical friction will tend to roughly average out across particles in general.  There is surely a very, very small effect (not unlike the tiny effect of gravitational radiation) but nowhere even remotely close to significant on cosmological scales.

In the end,  you're not really changing the total kinetic energy of all the bodies involved, so outside of dynamical friction between dark matter and baryonic matter which might result in one gaining kinetic energy and the other losing some, dark matter-dark matter dynamical friction will average out.

>Depending on the specifics and the maths, this mechanism could take a few days to erode an orbit. Or, it could be so weak that a particle's orbit wouldn't be noticeably decayed before the heat death of the universe.

Undoubtedly it would require tremendous timescales far longer than the age of the universe before this effect became statistically noticable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/esaqzr/if_dark_matter_does_not_interact_with_normal/

wadss,2018-04-10,2.0,"thats how science works.  the prevailing theory is one that best supports the observations.  dark matter by far is the best model we currently have that matches all the observations we have of different things in the sky.  and so we're dedicating alot of resources in many fields like particle physics and cosmology to learning more about dark matter.

there is absolutely nothing stopping anyone from coming up with a better model that would fit observations better.  it's just that nobody has been able to do that yet.  there is no absolute truths in science, it's always a work in progress.

and so it's not a stretch to keep anything relevant, but that there are no viable alternative models.  i just don't understand why there are so many people that think they know better than people that have spent 10+ years in university and graduate school learning physics and astronomy.  to refute or contribute to science, you have to first understand what came before and why things are the way they are.   the people that work on MOND are some of the smartest people in the field, because it's much more theoretical in nature vs experimental (observational), and MOND is falling off as a contender vs dark matter because those extremely brilliant minds aren't making progress vs the mounting evidence that support dark matter.

if i come out and claim that ""i think illness is caused by demons and witchcraft. i don't buy that we can actually see bacteria and viruses.""  i'd be treated like an insane person.  just because *i'm* ignorant of the evidence and how we are able to obtain that evidence, doesn't mean that evidence doesn't exist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/9kur6b/black_holes_ruled_out_as_universes_missing_dark/

wadss,2018-04-10,1.0,"to clarify, when i say most gasses, i mean when we want to look at stuff outside of the milky way, we always  choose to look perpendicular to the plane of the disk of the milky way, where there is the least amount of interstellar medium to get in the way.  in that sense, its the stuff we're looking at thats mostly optically thin (depending on the frequency), because we're not considering the stuff in the milky way.

cross section does depend on frequency, but it's not a straightforward relationship.  you have to consider both absorption and scattering.  low energy photons get scattered easily by dust particles their wavelengths are comparable to the size of the dust grains. on the other hand,  you would expect that higher energy photons would have a easier time passing through the ISM, and while thats true that its got a smaller scattering cross section, it could be absorbed more easily.  for instance the lyman-alpha atomic transition of neutral hydrogen, it's really good at absorbing UV photons, and so we can use the dimming of UV photons in a region to determine the density of hydrogen in the area.

but my point is that when we're looking out of the milky way, where redshift is important, we are very careful in looking in a spot where local emission and absorption is a non-factor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/9kur6b/black_holes_ruled_out_as_universes_missing_dark/

hat_swap,2013-11-08,1.0,"So I am a condensed matter physicist and dark matter is very far removed from what I do. However, I can outline some basics and perhaps someone with a more proper background can provide a more detailed response for those interested. To begin, think back to when you would ride on a merry-go-round as a child. The faster it spins, the harder you have to hold on with your hands to keep from being flung off. The same goes for galaxies. That is to say, something has to hold on to the stars that make up these galaxies as they rotate about their center. The 'hands', in this case, that hold the stars in place is the net gravity of the galaxy. This gravity acts to pull everything into a common center. So you have a merry go round force pushing out and gravity pulling in. These conspire to cancel one another out and that, in a very small nutshell, is how galaxies both acquire and maintain their shape. This would be the end of the story, however when we carry out the actual calculations, we find that there is not enough mass to keep these galaxies from tearing themselves apart as they rotate!

To account for this discrepancy, it is postulated that these galaxies have mass that we cannot 'see'. Now, what does it mean to say we cannot see it? We mean something stronger than just that it does not emit, absorb, or reflect visible light. A more appropriate phrase would be that it does not interact strongly with regular matter. Of course this just begs the question, what does it mean to interact? And this is where the 4 fundamental forces of nature come into the story. Every (known) interaction that takes place between particles is done so via one of these four forces. So which ones would we expect dark matter to interact with? There is the strong force which bonds protons and neutrons into atomic nuclei (as the name implies, dark matter clearly should not interact with other matter via this force) so we can exclude it. Next, there is the electromagnetic force, which bonds atomic nuclei into molecules. As it turns out, on the proper length scale, this force is actually much stronger than the strong force. Moreover, this force is also responsible for generating light, so dark matter would clearly not be dark if it interacted with this force. This leave gravity and the weak force as the two remaining forces. The whole reason we postulate dark matter exists is to account for excess gravity, so clearly it must interact with this force. Thus, that leaves only the weak force (which, among other things, is responsible causing many types of particles to decay.) It is possible that dark matter does interact via both gravity and the weak force. However, because the weak force is so weak this means that it has nearly no effect on regular matter. Indeed, one of the leading theories of dark matter, WIMPS, which stands for weakly interacting massive particles, claims that this is the case . 

Of course there are many theories. Indeed, among the different other ideas as to what dark matter is, there exists another idea that dark matter does not exist at all. Instead, it is postulated that the equations of motion we use to calculate galactic rotation are not completely accurate (it would not be the first time this sort of thing has happened.) Specifically, it is Newton's equation Force = Mass * Acceleration that needs to be modified. This comes with its own acronym: MONDS, modified Newtonian dynamics. The idea is that F=M*A is correct when you have really big accelerations. However, for a massive galaxy, the amount of acceleration each star feels is actually very, very small. In this case, F=M*A is wrong; but just by a little bit. Not much at all really, but it does not take much to account for the mass discrepancy that we see. Scientists have actually worked out exactly what this modification would have to be and, when applied, they have found that it explains the mass discrepancy over a surprisingly wide array of different types of galaxies. I should stress that I am playing a bit of devils advocate here since MONDS is not well received in the scientific community (as far as I know), since it cannot explain other things that dark matter can, such as gravitational lensing in open space (ie: an odd bending of light that takes place in regions of space where no matter is visible.) Still, the idea of MONDS is instructive in the sense that it demonstrates that dark matter, what it is and what it is not, is still very much an open question.",https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1k3fho/eli5_dark_matter/
bla2bla1bla,2013-11-08,0.0,"**Dark Matter**
To understand Dark Matter you have to know what normal matter is.
so anything you can see or touch is matter. and thing that has weight or ""mass"" is matter. some examples are : air, marbles, cats, dogs, stars, planets all that stuff.
As far as we can tell mater interacts with the magnetic spectrum OR regular light turn on a flash light and it reflects light back to your eye balls and you can see a what was once dark. all matter as we knew it interacted with some for of the magnetic spectrum, regular light or some form of radio waves or radiation.
Now Dark matter DOES NOT. lets say you had a box full of dark matter you could lift it up and it would be heavy, you could probably touch it too and maybe would feel like thick water (huge speculation right there) but you could not see it. flash a light on it and it will not reflect from it it would just pass right through it making it seem invisible. Not Black or dark (the absence of light) but invisible we could not see anything and the light would only reflect the bottom of the box. (another big speculation) so the truth is we have NO IDEA what dark matter is. all we know is 1. its heavy 2. we cant see it and can not interact with it in any way we normally would.
that's all for dark matter.

**Dark Energy**
*Dark energy is something else entirely and I wish we called it something else. we have to get in to astronomy. so we live on a planet that is in a solar system witch is in a local star cluster (a meh star cluster) in the Galaxy Milky way. there are other and as far as we know the universe gets big...really big. however we did not know if the universe was getting bigger or smaller or just hanging out at a set size. soon we found out about this stuff that is in us around us and all over everything, we cant see it, we can not interact with it, and it does not have any mass, so its got no weight. we starting to thing wtf is it doing? and its pushing ever so slightly on everything (in another spacial detentions is what a lot of people thing. by that I mean NOT up/down left/right forward/back, its pushing some other direction, yeah wrap your head around that bit lol sorry) this slight pressure or FORCE is gaining momentum and getting faster and slowly pushing EVERYTHING apart. now since we have only watched this for a short amount of time and its such a small force that we only just started to see its effects we do not know what it will eventually do or what part it plays in us as we are all a part of the same universe.
but some people do think it will push every everything apart so much so that eventually the elections will be pushed away from protons and matter its self will just be gone... I think that is ""the big chill"" type of the end of the universe. anyway that's dark energy for you, its just a weak little force that we hardly noticed at all but has a profound effect on reality

SirAnthos,2013-11-08,1.0,"Most of these answers are good but maybe some context?


So some astronomers were trying to calculate how much mass is in a certain galaxy. One possible way to do it was taking some ratios of mass, spin rate, and radius. There were other ways too, such as a ratio of luminosity and mass. They came to a startling conclusion. The galaxy was spinning too fast for the amount of light they can see. So they thought, there must be a lot of mass that isn't shining light. They called this Dark Matter.


There are many of candidates for dark matter at the moment. Someone posted something about WIMP. Those are massive neutral particles. There could be stars that are dead or extremely dim; like black holes, white dwarfs/neutron stars, or something called a brown dwarf. The last, and in my opinion most likely, a large expansive halo of cold hydrogen gas encompassing the galaxy. Though, even that has it's own problems, being that that's a lot of cold hydrogen gas. It could be all of those things.


I saw someone post about supermacro gravity might work differently than on solar system scale, and I think this could be bullocks, but who knows. There could be a factor of gravity that doesn't take over unless the scale is galactic clusters, and there is no dark matter.

SecureThruObscure,2013-10-08,34.0,"Dark, in this context, means ""not understood,"" or ""vague,"" sort of the opposite of ""known."" 

So dark matter is unknown matter.  We know *something* with mass exists, and we know that something isn't like Planets, Stars and the matter they're made up of.  This matter accounts for most of the mass in the universe.  If it wasn't there, the Universe would behave really, really differently because we can see the effect it has on the universe (gravitational lensing, or the effect of bending lights path through the universe with mass and the gravitational effect of Galaxies both spring to mind). 

Dark Energy, same applies.  Only instead of mass, it's seems to be a force that we don't understand that's feeding the expansion of the universe.  The expansion of the universe is accelerating, and without dark energy (simply an energy we don't understand the cause of) it should either be slowing down or retracting (in fact, it should still be expanding without dark energy, but slowing down).

We can do a lot of things because we can detect mass, But none of our other senses or instruments we've made has ever been able anything detect anything else.

artifex28,2015-07-08,2.0,"Interesting idea! Time dilation is certainly easier to explain to people if you first get them to understand that photons are ""subjectively out of time"", being everywhere at all time (if you'd ask that photon, that is).

In the core of the hypothesis you've time, which as you point out, is subjective. From the viewpoint of a photon time doesn't exist. At same time [we do know that even light speed isn't constant even in vacuum after all.](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/speed-light-not-so-constant-after-all)

That has few implications.

* The photons aren't all the same
* As light means the photons, the light speed is the local maximum speed, but in different areas of space, that varies. Due to what? What causes the photons to slow down?
* As the photons slow down relatively to the location/properties of the vacuum, do they speed up again?

What kind of impact does this have to the subjective time of a photon? If so, are the photons actually excluded from the effects of the time after all? During the acceleration, isn't the ""time slope"" actually curved? What accelerates the time? What causes the time to be a linear slope? And as there's something that can cause change in the light speed, isn't it logical to presume that there's external dimensions around us that have an impact to ours?

An ""external observer"" certainly can see a photon travel from point A to B, which means that a location/time coordinate could be assigned to every single photon in the existence.

To my main point.

I claim that time is nothing but an emergent property of ANY non-static system. If there's any change in the system, time exists. An external observer (eg. a higher dimensional being, that can manipulate the lower dimensions as they wish), could always use ""time"" as a search term if you had index built from every single event that occurs in the system. If everything was static however, there wouldn't be time, since no matter how much the ""external observer"" tried, he never could find any events in the system. Nothing changes. The system ""just is"".

We know that photons are carriers and cannot be destroyed, only absorbed. This means that a system CANNOT be dynamic, unless photons or similar carriers exist, causing entropy and thus change. So could the photons be in the core of the mystery here? Or even more likely, a higher dimensional structure having an impact to our ""static photons"", forcing the change of light speed in vacuum. Who knows.

Let's presume it is. I've always enjoyed this video depicting non-spatial dimensions, which essentially is nothing but a logical explanation how to form groups. It's nothing but a thought process, so wouldn't be too harsh on it, which the hard scientists tend to do quite often when discussing on that video. *No man! 4th dimension is an actual spatial space*. Well it is, if you want to depict 4th dimension as a 4th spatial dimension. But dimension itself can be anything as long as there's a coordinate with a new axis. You can stack the previous data on X-axis and depict everything on a 2D yet.

Anyways, check the video. --> [Imagining in 10th dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqeqW3g8N2Q)

DiogenesHoSinopeus,2015-07-08,3.0,"Dark energy doesn't really fit into anything currently known about the laws of physics either, only that the red-shift can be explained by the presence of this energy. It's a necessary evil at this moment and it really only creates more questions than it answers. **As far as I am aware** the only real evidence for the existence of Dark Energy and the apparent red-shift/expansion at all are the ""standard candles"" that rely on the assumptions that we know enough about supernovae and variable stars to gauge their brightness accurately. Their usefulness/accuracy for measuring distances is still controversial.  
  
Dark matter is not related to dark energy, so my theory is not a threat to the existence of dark matter and it shouldn't interfere with it.  
  
As for the Big Bang: nothing can currently explain it. My theory would change things a little in the time right after the Big Bang in a way that instead of space expanding faster than the speed of light (*during the great inflation*), time ran backwards at an unfathomable rate. We know that our universe **is** currently cooling down and that entropy is increasing. According to my theory, during this rapid time-reversal-period the universe would have become unimaginably hot and entropy would have ran backwards as far as it can all the way to perfect uniformity. We know that the conditions right after the Big Bang **were** exactly these (*hot, uniform and 0 in entropy*), it fits perfectly with my theory. The whole universe resets as the clock runs backwards. This also removes the question ""*why did entropy start at 0?*"". Since we already know that entropy increases over time, the only possible conclusion of that fact is that, if time reversed it would inevitably become 0 during backwards-time-travel if it increases during forward-time-travel.  
  
There is a way to test my theory and if it is true however. It would be to measure if signals from a probe sent into space are red-shifted the further they are from us even if they are not moving away. Though the problem here is that the red-shift would be so immeasurably small that there is no practical way of ever measuring it. If we would use Voyager-1's signal for the experiment, it's frequency would have shifted 1/6.5 billionth from the emitted frequency. Differences that small are practically impossible to measure outside of very strict and perfectly controlled laboratory settings with lasers on a table.  
  
As to ""*why*"" would time behave like this. I have no explanation for that. I don't know if time will reverse again on its own or if it will keep accelerating indefinitely. The only way to create the conditions of a Big Bang would be to reverse time entirely and the only phenomenons currently known that could possibly do that are super massive black holes. Inside each could be another another Big Bang happening...and that's not even a new idea in the scientific community.

[deleted],2015-06-08,0.0,"One time when I was REALLY high, I came up with this theory. The universe is collapsing and that's the reason gravity exists. When matter decays, it becomes dark matter, and the space that the physical matter once occupied is now virtually empty so space collapses in on it. Bigger objects with more matter have more decaying matter at once so more space collapses in on it. When the space collapses, all matter around it converge on that location, making gravity.

Then I went into thinking about how the universe collapses as two sides of a wave. The expansion being the rising side. Well, a full cycled sine wave is 360 degrees and the rise and fall / expansion and collapse could only represent 180 degrees of our universe. The last 180 degrees could be like some sort of anti universe. 

Then I sobered up and read what I wrote t down and thought ""wtf?"". I mean the space collapsing thing would only work if the gravity provided by the decaying matter would be greater in exchange for the lost matter.

towerhil,2015-06-08,2.0,"It's too even to be black holes, so it'd be noticeable if it were concentrated like that, even if the black holes were spread out. If they were big there would be lensing evidence, if they were small they'd be ridiculously numerous, like 10x as numerous as stars and would stil exhibit lensing effects. I think it's time to discard what was a promising idea and concentrate on what it really is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3fzyug/what_is_dark_matter_and_dark_energy/

banana_and_2_kiwis,2015-06-08,1.0,"Think about when electricity was being introduced, if people had taken your advice, they would have been occupied with flaws in Newtonian mechanics (instead of assuming there's something else - like electric field) and I don't think it would've gotten them very far... it's a pretty similar situation now, though. Back then people would be like (observing behavior of charged pieces of matter) ""ok, so these particles are just behaving strangely"" and they could either be like ""there must be something wrong with our existing laws- the conservation of energy is clearly wrong and most likely every other law in our mechanics"" or ""there's something else, the undiscovered field, energy, the undiscovered properties of matter"" and most of the time the second kind of thinking got us somewhere (for instance, through this way of thinking we discovered electromagnetic field and the quantum mechanics model that works somehow (thanks to which you have now your computer or cellphone in front of you) , whereas the first one never got us anywhere..

 I don't think there's such thing as wrong in science- if one formula works for specific circumsances, it works, it won't be changed, but the formula can get more advanced (however, it will be transformed to this old same formula for those cases) . For example, if you observe a specific case of classical dynamics, you can get pretty complicated equations (with all the double/triple integrals, matrices etc. etc.)  out of nothing more than the simple Newton's laws. And what I think is that our knowledge now knows these equations for specific cases, but doesn't yet know the ""Newton's laws"" , yet that doesn't make those old equations wrong, it's rather a  fulfillment of our old formulas. 
And I'm sure there are a lotttt of things unknown to us...

amolad,2015-06-08,-5.0,"Very good. Most atheists--and people--do not understand that God is NOT religion. Also, that man's free will is so sacrosanct that the being we call God wants you to think for yourself if there is a ""God"" or not. 

That is why there has been no ""proof"" of the existence of God. That would force humans to take a side. However, that proof is coming very soon but in a way that does not infringe man's free will.

It's the same for dark matter. We don't really know what it is but, according to some, it's a higher plane of existence that we can't really see or define yet. ALL the beings and things on other planets are made of it. Which is why they don't land their spacecraft in the middle of our cities. To do so would infringe on our free will.

All of these questions will be answered sooner than most people think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3fzyug/what_is_dark_matter_and_dark_energy/
