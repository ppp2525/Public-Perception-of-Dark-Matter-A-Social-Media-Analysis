JP Seet,2024-03-23 04:05:03,1.0,"From the article: ""Dark matter is one of the most important things in astrophysics, and we know next to nothing about it.""In my Humble Opinion (IMHO), Dark Matter is definitely an important subject in cosmology and astrophysics. It seems to me that we do know a little about it. For example, since Vera Rubin's work in the 1970s, Galaxy rotation curves are known to indicate the presence of Dark Matter, perhaps in the Galaxy halo !? Though, to be fair, the opening paragraph of the article does also mention these ""gravitational effects"".So Alex McDaniel's study of dwarf galaxies is the path featured in this article.""Dwarf galaxies are ideal for study because they are small, rich in dark matter and mostly lack other astrophysics phenomena such as gas, dust and supernova that could contaminate the findings.""""We look for these because ideally, they give us a clean signal or allow us to rule out certain particle theories""."".... compared to previous studies, we do start to see a hint of something that might be a signal from these systems [ dark matter having a certain mass and cross section, I think ].""I don't have time to read the actual paper, though it would be interesting to know, what aspects the concept of a signal in this context involves. It would be neat and logical if the idea of a signal was mysterious and evolving, if you get my drift !! That's because, I don't think there are yet many certainties about what exotic particle(s) Dark Matter may be !!ðð",https://m.facebook.com/share/p/CtL5vD9ph3w95wkt/?mibextid=UIerB5

So they get funding and when they are wrong they get even more funding in hope they set it right which is mathematical impossible. The Scientific Money perpetual mobile.

Ron Kemp,2024-04-25 15:45:07,1.0,"Dark matter is an artifact.  When the motion of a star or galaxy like our Milky Way cannot be explained by the amount of mass in the system the first thing done is blame it on dark matter.  Dark matter becomes a wildcard variable that can be used in any situation when the laws of motion and theory of gravity cannot fully explain.  This doesn't mean it exists.  It simply means the laws of motion and theory of gravity are incomplete, can't explain the motion.  Dark matter is the ""placeholder, wildcard, or whatever you want to call it to explain what theories and laws cannot.I believe I discovered what they neglected to include in their equations.  It's a slow but constant acceleration that only occurs to stars and galaxies over time because they radiate a rapid wind of hot charged particles.  Once in motion always in motion unless acted upon by an outside force.  Well, stars and galaxies produce a solar wind, which is an action.  Then what is the reaction?  The reaction is a slow but constant acceleration in the direction they're already traveling.  Thus the older the star or galaxy is, the more momentum they will have gained over time.Sure enough, young diffuse galaxies don't appear to be affected by dark matter.  Planets and other small bodies are not affected by dark matter.  Young stars do not appear to be affected by dark matter.  The key word is young.  Because the bodies are young then this slow acceleration would not show up in measurements.I believe I even came up with a value that explains it.  A slow but constant acceleration of 0.00000482 in/s (0.0000122 cm/s).  It's about twice the width of a proton every second.  It comes out to be around a 1 mi/h (1.61 km/h) increase in velocity every 10,000 years.  Slow but constant acceleration over the lifetime of the star or galaxy.  It's so slow that in our short lifetime, a maximum of 120 years we are unable to detect this acceleration.A galaxy like our Milky Way that is 13.7 billion years old would have accumulated an extra velocity of around 1,370,000 mi/h.  Our sun being 4.5 billion years old would have accumulated an extra 450,000 mi/h.  The older the star or galaxy is the more their motion will appear to be a mystery.I call it the AP theory for Accelerated Propulsion.It not only explains the extra motion but also explains why satellite galaxies and stars orbiting a galaxy faster than a million miles per hour are unable to reach an escape velocity.  Think about it.  If the acceleration is a constant 0.00000482 in/s (0.0000122 cm/s) then it's not enough of a jolt to change their orbital trajectory.  So they will continue to orbit, never able to reach an escape velocity regardless of the velocity they've accumulated over time.Thus why the book I published about this is called DARK MATTER IS DEAD by Ron Kemp.  Mystery solved.  The motion blamed on dark matter or missing mass is actually a slow but constant acceleration occurring to stars and galaxies over time.  There is no need to assume dark matter particles, things that can't be measured or observed if stars and galaxies are slowly propelling themselves.I provided this knowledge freely.  Don't hate me.  If you don't agree, then please explain why.",https://m.facebook.com/share/4iGhQYkgLyKWRFeZ/?mibextid=Cx5MWH

Valeriy Polulyakh,2021-05-28 19:34:08,5.0,"Recently two papers have been published. The first one [1] deals with the measurement of the speed of rotation of galaxies and, in our view, closes the issue of the existence of dark matter. The second one [2] argues that the expansion of the universe is not accelerating. However, this fact does not answer the question as to what in general is the cause of the universe's expansion and does not address the widespread opinion that 70% of the universe consists of dark energy. The central idea of a new paradigm [3, 4] is an existence of a certain entity â the elaston, which can give rise to the physical Euclidean space, matter and energy all the way along its evolution. Investigations of the large scale structure of the World revealed its high non-homogeneity. The foam-like structure becomes more and more obvious. The building blocks of the large scale structure are superclusters and voids which are forming the supercluster-void network. The new paradigm gives the key to the explanation of such a structure.  https://www.academia.edu/31095808/There_Arent_any_Arguments_for_the_Existence_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy ",https://m.facebook.com/share/hmwoAXeRcMqBVibM/?mibextid=Cx5MWH

Usrzhx Hlesfk,2023-05-26 19:44:54,1.0,"A black hole is an astrophysical object at the level of which the equations of general relativity give infinite values; he constitutes a gravitational singularity in the space-time.Moreover, a black hole is in general relativity what the speed of light is in special relativity. So he doesn't swallow stars, planets or asteroids. And no massive body except another black hole can reach his event horizon.All this leads us to ask the following question: why have some astrophysicists tried to study what is beyond the event horizon of black holes using unrealistic models of gravitationnal quantum physics, when the quantum physics study matter at the subatomic level, while a black hole is an astophysical object that belong to a macroscopic world that is subject to the entropy and the arrow of time?Indeed, beyond the event horizon of each black hole there is a very large closed iron gate that sits at the base of a tower of an enormous fort constructed using extremely strong material. solid and compact. This fort is over 120,000 light-years tall, and it surrounds the entire Prime Heaven, while the solid ground of the Prime Heaven is the roof of the universe.Finally, in the First Heaven there is the House of Glory, Hell, and great white palaces.",https://m.facebook.com/share/Ujf7zPWXSZTmHgm5/?mibextid=Cx5MWH

James Allen McEuin,2024-08-03 15:49:44,0.0,"This article fails to state why dark anything was proposed in the first place. Dark anything simply means that the equation isn't balanced. Let's keep it simple with an easy math problem.  2 + ? = 4  We observe 4 and we can observe 2 but we can't observe what balances the left and the right. We assume that what we see on the right is the total so we assume there is another 2 that is missing and because we can't see it then it is dark to us. Neptune was predicted to exist based on gravitational effects and was visibly confirmed as a result of narrowing down the search field. Neptune was unknown, it was dark. The latest dark matter and energy theories exist because calculations of galactic and universal movements can't be balanced based on what is observed on either side of the equation. The false assumption is we can see all that can be seen. That said, after the Voyager craft left our solar system we ""surprisingly"" discovered that intergalactic space has more matter and energy than previously thought because it was not observed from Earth. Neither of these (matter or energy) observations were done with special dark matter detectors. Yes, I can acknowledge that we don't know what is all out there but the entire modern premise of dark matter and energy is about us knowing all about what we can interact with which is a false assumption. The truth is that not one dark anything experiment has proven anything. It is so bad that a university researcher who spoke at our local society stated that he hopes he is right because his entire financial livelihood is at stake so he will continue to propose research projects despite the lack of any proof because his degree and entire career is worthless otherwise and he would be financially ruined otherwise. So that really sums it up. Follow the money. The research only continues because it is the only way those who study it will ever do more than be a fry cook at your local fast food burger joint. The reality is that in the scientific community once you have been proven to have chased a false narrative all these years you won't be accepted elsewhere because you already proved yourself gullible and fallible in your ability to make good logical scientific conclusions.",https://m.facebook.com/share/qUmZmvy71kf21osf/?mibextid=Cx5MWH

Azor Romão Da Mota Filho,2023-10-26 18:00:57,0.0,"Dark Matter is just the variation of the energy of free space, or vacuum.It is called dark ""matter"", because we believe that gravitational attraction is an exclusive property of matter, but in fact, it is a property of energy, for example, light, black hole and kinetic energy are types of energy subject to the action of gravity. The adjective ""dark"" occurs due to the lack of knowledge of its origin.The systematic error is to think that free space has constant energy density everywhere every time. In reality, we are confused by the fact that we can only measure energy density differences between one region and another, but we have not, until now, been able to measure the total energy density of free space in a region. Dark matter plays the role of the energy density of free space. The destructive interference of electromagnetic waves contributes to raising the energy of free space. This rise in energy is locally, but spreads and vanishes soon due the dynamical movement of everything. We only notice the difference from one region to the other of this energy, which we call ""dark matter"".This behavior can be easily verified in the experiment carried out by Louis Rancourt & Philip J. Tattersall[17]  in which the weight of a body is affected by a box of mirrors that reflect light in a zig zag pattern. The weight progressively increases in the direction of the box, as a function of time, indicating an accumulation of energy, which is progressively dissipated when lights are turned off.",https://m.facebook.com/share/v/pZ4ug4wCXryDcSa8/?mibextid=Cx5MWH

Yaseen Rauf,2017-08-23 21:06:54,0.0,"Dark matter acts to prevent galaxes from breaking apart despite their high speed spin that tries to scatter matter away. Such astronomical fact is mentioned in Quran ""the book given by Allah ""GOD"" to his messenger Mohammad 1400 years ago. Do not be surprised even dark energy is mentioned in Quran as well. Why to wonder it is just a proof that the One who created this universe is the One who sent Quran to his slave and prophet. So please read Quran and I quarantee to you that you will find some thing regarding your field, no matter what is your profession. Now let me mention to you how dark matter and dark energy are mentioned.Sura ""Chapter"" 35. verse [41] It is Allah Who sustains the heavens and the earth, lest they cease (to function): and if they should fail, there is none - not one - can sustain them thereafter: verily He is Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.Here the translator failed to give the full meaning because the word sustains is not a good match for ""Yumsik"" which means to hold. And the word cease and should fail he put for ""tazula, zalata"" which are actually one verb but one is in the present tense and the second is in the past tense which means to vanish or to move away from current position. The translater is trying to convene to us what he understands from the verse but what he understands reflects his level of knowledge. So I will try to put word by word translation so you will see the dark matter in this verse."" Verily, Allah holds the heavens and the earth lest they move away from their current position, and if they had moved away from their current position who holds them other than Allah.""Here the movement of heaven and earth as a whole so it is not the apparent relative movement of the stars with respect to earth or the actual elliptical movement of earth around the sun because such phenomena is mentioned in another verse. So it is a global movement of the stars and earth as one unit which is to my understanding is the movement of stars and with them their planets around the center of the galaxy. So the black matter which is centered at the centre of our Galaxy is holding the stars from flying away. Allah is the One who created the black matter to balance such eccentric forces due to high speed of spin. If Allah did not create such balancing mechanism then stars will scatter into Universe and who other than Allah will put them back on their initial orbits. So All praise is due to Allah who created such a thing. Allah mentioned this phenomena in Quran because He knows that a time will come when people will acquire such knowledge. So try to understand the great attributes of God. He is also Most-Forbearing, He does not send punishment instantly on wrong doers but rather He gives them time to repent and He Oft-Forgiving because He rewards a lot for tiny acts of good deeds.Sura 51 verse [47] With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create the vastness of Space.Here again I will put word for word translation to let you see the black energy is this verse. "" An the heaven We did construct with ""hands"" and Verily We are expanding the vastness of the sky"".The word ""hands"" is a metaphor in Arabic and it means lots of strength. Because an easy thing you can make with one hand a more difficult thing you need to engage both hands and for the extra difficult thing you need plenty of hands. And nothing can be difficult to Allah but it means that there are enormous energies in the outer space and these energies are embedded in different forms. In another verse Allah says ""the creation of the skies and the earth is bigger than the creation of the people but most of the people do not know."" In Arabic the word ""Muse'oon"" is used which literally means increasing the vastness but old arabs understood the metaphoric sense which means and we are capable of doing that or we have all the resources to do that. So Allah created the skies and the creation of the skies is not an easy task but Allah has the power and all the resources to do that. But now with greater knowledge at our hands we will allow ourselves to understand the literal meaning of ""Muse'oon"" which the physical sense of expanding space at higher rates. No matter in which direction you are looking into space you will see that the distance between galaxies is increasing. Allah is the One who created such a massive energy ""black energy"" that causes the universe to expand. Eventhough we don't see this energy but due its effect we know it exists. The same is true regarding the black matter. It does not emit any light due to it's high gravity so we do not see it but we see it's effect so we know it exists. Allah also no one can see him in this life but we see all these things around us as a proof that Allah exists and He is the creator of every thing, and we see reference to these scientific discoveries in Quran for us to know that Quran is from the Creator and is not man made.",https://m.facebook.com/share/v/bkw5F1S9qvwR8LEb/?

And since the distant star is lighter it can move faster than expected.",https://m.facebook.com/share/v/bkw5F1S9qvwR8LEb/?
