@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-15 03:55:01,0.0,"The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbxXNhZ78c&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@BrianCStratton,2023-08-12 21:00:41,0.0,"I would like to begin admitting I am an ignorant human but nonetheless very curiuos as well.

I know this may not sit well with physicists but I would like to present a very limited understanding of Buddhist cosmology because this presentation takes into account both the physical realms of the universe and non-physical realms of consciousness and may shed some inkling of insight into the ""matter."" 

Just as there are multiple planes or levels of consciousness that we can experience correspondingly, according to Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple planes in which consciousness can reside. Ths most subtle being the ""Formless realm"" where, as the name implies, there is no physical form yet consciousness resides. This is followed by the ""Form realm"", which does contain a subtle physical form, and then the ""desire realm"" where we are. To add to the complexity of this, there are multiple planes of existence within each of these realms in which beings, whose number, like the universe, is infinite, reside according to the karmic relationship of the cause-and-effect nature of consciousness and matter. 

Now for the relationship to the unfolding of cosmic inflation and the big bang. It is said that our universe, being one of infinite, is formed in stages from elements going from subtle to gross; begining with ""wind"" and settling into ""earth."" The ""winds"" churning, or power, or formation, is dependent on and has a direct relationship with consciousnesses in the formless realm. This wind, in turn,  creates fire, creating water, and then finally earth. Where t=0 in the formation of the universe only ""winds,"" and likewise formless beings,  were present driving inflation and evolution of the universe to the point where conditions for each successive element to form; the very hot dense beginning being fire, then water, then stars and planets corresponding to the element of earth. Each stage, likewise, becomes the physical conditions needed for the individual consciousness from the various realms to reside; as the universe formation evolves so too do its conscious inhabitants.

SO what is dark matter and energy?

I propose, and i am just saying this to spark imagination and possibility:

Dark matter = The beings residing on other planes in the universe that we are not able to (and my never be able to) detect 

Dark energy = The forces and interrelationship of matter and consciousness of the various beings that reside within the universe",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbxXNhZ78c&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@douglasking9383,2023-05-13 23:58:04,0.0,", there is no dark matter! It exists as a result of scientists fundamental misunderstanding of the comparison of the configurations of a solar system and a galaxy. You say they are the same but there are not. The solar system is like a system of balls orbiting around a central ball. Gravity holds the solar system in that particular configuration. The result is the inner balls orbit more quickly than the outer balls. Then you made the mistake of visualizing the galaxies as a similar system of balls orbiting around a central point. That is, in fact, not the case at all. Have you ever heard of an amusement park ride called The Octopus? Its an attraction that has several seats located along the tentacles of the 'octopus' that radiate outward. The patrons sit on the seats which are flung around on these tentacles at speed. The thing about this ride is it resembles very closely how spinning galaxies look face on. Gravity, in the case of the galaxies, holds the stars in a similar manner to seats on our Octopus. Gravity binds the stars within chains of fellow stars that radiate out of the central point of the galaxy, like tentacles of an octopus. That's the galaxy's configuration, which is different from that of the solar system. You may observe that the Octopus tentacles orbit the centre at a constant speed so that the inner seats move at the same speed as the outer seats. Now imagine that the tentacles of our amusement park Octopus are flexible so that the outer seats are whipped out at a greater speed than the inner seats. This is exactly what we see with galaxies, the outer stars are moving faster than the inner stars because of this whipping effect. Nowhere in my explanation does it require the existence of so-called ""dark matter"". 

If we picture the Universe as a spiral, not too dissimilar to a galaxy where the 'stars' are galaxies, then the red shift is just an indication of the furthest galaxies being whipped about like the arms of the galaxies. No dark matter needed. The existence of dark energy can be explained by substituting dark matter in its place. Unless you can provide an example that can be explained with dark energy exclusively, I don't see the need for dark energy at all.

@TomHendricksMusea,2023-02-03 01:42:09,0.0,"Dark matter suggests something is wrong with our understanding of gravity.  But it also may support my ideas that Dark Energy,  Anti Gravity  is the force.
The force that pushes behind mass to move it forward, and the force in front that resists its acceleration and causes it to have mass.
Gravity = Acceleration?

Does the Earth PULL the APPLE to the ground or
Does the Sky PUSH the APPLE to the ground?
 
Which is correct:  GRAVITY is pulling matter together or ANTI GRAVITY, another name for DARK ENERGY, is pushing it together?  
Which is correct:  GRAVITY, is inside MATTER somewhere, or ANTI GRAVITY is outside everywhere in empty SPACE?   

DARK ENERGY in physics is defined as a repulsive force that counteracts gravity and causes the universe to expand everywhere at an accelerating rate.  My suggestion is that DARK ENERGY is ANTI GRAVITY.  
Most likely it is ZERO POINT ENERGY, The  COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT and VIRTUAL PARTICLES too.

My next suggestion is that  THERE IS NO GRAVITY!  

My idea is similar to a universe wide CASIMIR EFFECT on all matter. Here, instead of two metal plates being pushed together, there are ""plates"" of matter and the expanding space around them, pushing them together. 

Dr Einstein said his breakthrough came when he imagined an analogy of an elevator in space.  As acceleration increases, gravity increases.  The person in the elevator can't tell if he is in an elevator traveling in space or one on Earth.  
BUT WHAT IF WE ARE BOTH RIGHT.

Look at the drawing.


There are two round elevators.  

The elevator on the left IS NOT  accelerating.
No acceleration = No gravity
The force of empty space or anti gravity,  pushes on all sides equally.  

The elevator on the right IS accelerating.
Acceleration  = Gravity.
The force of empty space or anti gravity,  pushes on all sides, but mostly from the front due to acceleration!  The acceleration scrunches up the forces in front. They overlap each other from the elevator accelerating into them.  These cumulative, empty space, forces, push back more and more as the elevator accelerates in that forward direction.
This causes gravity. Acceleration = Gravity!

More exactly the forces of ANTI GRAVITY cause matter to experience what we call gravity.

So: acceleration of an object in space causes space to push back. This is what we have been calling gravity but is anti gravity.

Some will say:
But it's so obvious, the Sun goes around the Earth, and the apple falls to the ground.
Yes they seem obvious.  But both are wrong!

My previous posts, part of a single paper covering all these ideas, suggested that before the Big Bang, there  was a singularity of photons, an eternal dimensionless point of energy.
Then the force that expanded out of the Big Bang and started the universe, and time space, was DARK ENERGY; a subset of the singularity of photons.

So Gravity from stars and planets was never PULLING matter together.  The opposite was true: Anti Gravity or DARK ENERGY from empty space was expanding and PUSHING matter together from all sides! 

THERE IS NO GRAVITY pulling anything together.   THERE IS ONLY ANTI GRAVITY or DARK ENERGY expanding and pushing matter on all sides. This can explain acceleration in elevators, rocket propulsion; the rubber sheet analogy, why no light escapes black holes, space expansion, curvature of space, and why there is so little gravity in the quantum world.

...
Three Follow Ups.

1. Remember the rubber sheet analogy? The rubber sheet is space pushing on all sides. That's the force I'm talking about that causes what we call gravity.
Q. The implication is clear (or at least, it was clear to Einstein): Gravity causes acceleration, and acceleration causes gravity. They are absolutely identical

2. Galileo's experiment, later recreated on the moon shows a hammer and feather dropping and hitting the ground at the same time. This supports space pushing them , not the attraction of their weight.

3. Doppler Effect: Waves emitted by a source traveling towards an observer get compressed. 

4. The greatest force in the universe is dark energy,  the energy of empty space.  Dark energy is 70% of all energy. It has such force that its expanding the universe  everywhere  all the time, and is now speeding up.

5. Dark matter suggests that we need a different theory of gravity.  Dark energy or anti gravity  would explain both as the force from empty space pushing matter forward, and the force in front of matter resisting its acceleration and giving it mass.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbxXNhZ78c&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@michaelkahn8744,2022-11-20 02:32:28,0.0,"There's no Dark Matter. There's no Dark Energy either.
Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.

However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?

The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1,  ?2,  ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.

The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter.

Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.

Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.

As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbxXNhZ78c&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@richardcollins5549,2020-02-20 00:29:36,1.0,"Would you please stop using rubber sheets and flexible membranes to represent gravity.  It is three dimensional.  More like a gas with density, pressure, momentum, energy. vorticity, magnetic moment, charge, concentrations of things.  All that is required is a simple 3D visualization like a point cloud.  Please!  a rubber sheet and bowling ball might have been good enough three decades ago, but we certainly can do much better than that now.  If it will help you, then think of the gravitational potential itself, and its associated gradient, the gravitational accelerations. The physical vacuum is not a bad way to remember.  Change the reflectivity, transparency for every voxel according to some reasonable visualization. 


We don't any Internet wide standard for 3D videos.  We should. Then you could change your viewpoint while the 3D video to let you see things from different places, and at different time rates (change over a vast range of frame rates to see details invisible to humans).  If you integrate the gravitational energy density, that value can be calculated for every point in space.  Is it exact or verified?  Not yet. But it is one place to start.  Even simple things like electron densities, axion densities and their respective flows, vorticities and temperature can have complex and beautiful periodic and chaotic structures.  You are representing a complex beautiful field with a cheap visualization.


So this old method is a lot misleading.  At least use the gravitational potential and then color it some way humans can see.  We false color radio telescope pictures and a vast number fields and signals that humans cannot directly see.  There are excellent models for the global gravitational and magnetic fields of the earth at the surface and into space.  They are in spherical harmonic forms, and real time measurement.  It takes a bit of looking to find a decent calculator, then a 3D visualizer.  But not impossible.  Maybe your friendly geophysicist or astrophysicist friends can do it for you.


Most people are not familiar with the gravitational energy density.  I only happened on it back in the 1970's after I met Joe Weber.  He told me to look at his student, Robert Forward's, work.  It is g^2/(8 pi G) in SI units, where g is in (meters/second^2), and G is 6.6743E-11 (meters/second^2) per (kilogram/meter^2).  At the surface of the earth the gravitational energy density is the same as a magnetic field of about 380 Tesla, a laser of 1.7E19 Watts/m^2 or a black body at 2.95 million Kelvin (not sure if this to within a factor 2 based on different model assumptions).  My point is that space is not empty by any means.  Even if you do not fill it with gravitons and axions, the gravitational potential itself is extremely stable and well understood.  At least color that in 3D so people can see it. And you will see that the earth's gravitational potential is dwarfed by the sun.


The gravitational potential changes constantly because of changes in the atmosphere, oceans, and earth on the earth, and changes on the sun and moon and more distant sources of gravitational potential change.  So if you really want to get fancy show how that is changing constantly.  The time dilation equation used for GPS time corrections can be used to show how that changes with time. And it is well defined everywhere in space, so you could plot the rate of clocks, or the vacuum index of refraction, anywhere on earth or in space or on the sun or on the moon - as a function of time.  Many many experiments on earth and in space are now sensitive enough to measure these changes in the potential. And many more can measure the gradient of the gravitational potential, the gravitational acceleration.  Any 3D video would be fine. 


Thank you for listening.  Please don't use that rubber sheet any more. Gravity is not a rubber sheet!!


I have to deal with the gravitational potential every day.  My own view is that it is filled with gravitons, axions, quarks, gluons and neutrinos in different concentrations. These vary in mass and number density, velocity and cross section.  It might be wrong, but that simple step greatly simplified things for me.  And gave me a more concrete thing to ""see"" with my human mind when I try to visualize the action of the gravitational potential field at atomic, subnuclear and global scales.  I guess I am more a chemist.  I like to count moles of gravitons, and not leave them invisible and transparent, even if my human eyes cannot see them.

Because physics does not limit the speed of any individual piece of spacetime compared to any other piece... I want to offer a seed of thought. - Gravity moves faster than 'C'. - The old mental experiment... If the sun just vanished... We would see the sunlight for 8(+) minutes... It has been put forward that the Earth would continue to move around where the sun was at for that same 8(+) minutes because the gravity from the sun would also last that long... Because of the speed of 'C'. But if gravity... The warping of spacetime, moves faster than 'C'... The Earth would fling out of orbit faster than the visible light from the sun would vanish. - A gravity wave (or ripple in spacetime) is in effect an Alcubierre-style warp, with no laws of physics limiting it's speed. - I have some possible consequences to this thought. - Let's follow the birth and evolution of a particular gravity wave... I'll call him Gerard. Gerard is formed by the orbits of two massive objects and radiates outward. He behaves as we have learned that he behaves... But at the point where we think that he has expanded (or dissipated) to being ineffective to the matter that he encounters... The actuality of his existence is something different. He joins a vast 'flow' of every bit of gravity ever birthed... And contributes to this flow. Amplifying the other gravity waves... As he is also amplified. This flow has eddies and back-washes where matter accumulates... And becomes (among other things) galaxies. The matter that grows in these eddies of gravity 'flow' can be seen to move too fast for its own gravity and we think it should be spinning itself apart... But actually, the gravity that keeps the galaxies together is from the outside 'flow' - Not the inside mass, or more accurately - both. - Dark matter does not exist... When we map the areas where we see more gravity... and call it dark matter... What we are seeing is the 'flow' of all the gravity that was ever birthed. If we want to move to other parts of this galaxy - And even to other galaxies... We need to harness this 'flow'... And surf. :)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W3RsaWuCuE

1960-70´s
Observing the spiral galaxies 
Rotation of bodies
More distance from the sun, slower the orbiting
Then you can get the sun's gravity
Then you get it's mass
Using the same method for the galaxies 
Movement and velocity is calculated through the Doppler shift 
Lead to unexpected results:
Clouds were moving faster, the farther out from the center
Velocities flattened out with distance instead of declining 
Implying a constant gravity, instead of a decreasing 
What gravity was keeping them from flinging off?
What mass was causing the rapid rotation rates?
We couldn't see them, so...
""Dark"" material is contributing to the gravity
Galaxy must be embedded in a halo of it to fit the shape of the rotation
There must be 5-6 times more of it than visible material
85% of the universe
So what is it? 
Cold gas? Dust? Dead star? Rogue planets? Subatomic particles? 
They didn't emit light
The signs contradicted everything made of normal matter (atoms)
Except invisible subatomic particles from quantum mechanics
These are just possibilities 
Like Axions: has mass, little light and and passes through matter
Space is like a fabric with matter and energy embedded in it 
Gravity is a bending of this fabric 
Like a bowling ball on a mattress would warp its surface
Light bends along the distortion of space caused by gravity
Gravitational lensing: 
Effect of the matter between a light source and its observer, on the light
So: more mass, more gravity, more light bending
A cluster of galaxies have a lot of mass
So by being far away their light bends towards us
Bullet Cluster:
Two colliding galaxies
Their colliding gases get hot and emit x-rays 
Bullet Cluster distorted it's background 
Using that we could map it's mass 
And see the matter that wasn't the hot gas and didn't emit light",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W3RsaWuCuE

There certainly exists a particle physical mold inside the earth that enables composition of our bodies with exactly the same number and type of parts (2 eyes, 32 teeth, 6 main bone types ~ head, torso, 2 arms, 2 legs) being delivered through PLANTS as food, air and water to be assembled by other already delivered ones - several millions of times every single day.

There are no special experiments and/or observations needed to understand this fact, but ONLY the readiness to functionally link the 3 entities (PLANTS, ANIMALS and HUMANS) systematically to derive the mathematical model of this mold to precisely specify how particle interactions inside the earth develop PLANTS on its own surface, to then deliver and sustain beings here through them.

Once we get this model ready we can steer the process in such a way that all evil (disasters, predation, diseases ~ including all birth defects and violence ~ and death) can be PREVENTED by acting on their sources while they are still inside the earth, so that they never reach the surface to harm any being.

It's very special to be able to follow along on the history through the current interpretations of all of these incredible concepts. I'd heard of and read about many of these concepts already, but it's always been difficult to map these discoveries chronologically, and with respect to how each concept interacts with another to help build out the model. We've come a long way since Galileo and even Newton. The only dissatisfying thing about these episodes is the realization that too few of our youth and young adults are being taught these concepts in even their simplest forms. Our younger generations are downright ignorant of these concepts and of the immense bodies of work gone into mapping the history of our reality. They don't understand for even a moment that driving a car or using a cell phone invokes countless invisible and unnoticeable concepts that brilliant minds of the past were determined to solve. In solving them, they made it a possibility to actually harness these things to create technology that today we can't imagine being without. It's so bad nowadays that not only are they ignorant, but they're creating counter-theories and denying previous discoveries. They think of them as conspiracies and frauds. Flat-Earthers and moon landing deniers come to mind, but there are many more that are just too stupid to take seriously. Not enough young people are being taught about scientific discovery in the fields of physics and astronomy, and about how those scientific genres actually affect their lives.

I'm looking forward to more scientific edudion on the subject.
Maybe we can see it when the discovery of dark matter has been made. 

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of p0ru model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

@BrianCStratton,2023-08-12 20:58:00,0.0,"I would like to begin admitting I am an ignorant human but nonetheless very curiuos as well.

I know this may not sit well with physicists but I would like to present a very limited understanding of Buddhist cosmology because this presentation takes into account both the physical realms of the universe and non-physical realms of consciousness and may shed some inkling of insight into the ""matter."" Please not that this description was given over 2,500 years ago to an audience in which  telescopes were not available...

Just as there are multiple planes or levels of consciousness that we can experience correspondingly, according to Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple planes or dimensions in which consciousness can reside. Ths most subtle being the ""Formless realm"" where, as the name implies, there is no physical form yet consciousness resides. This is followed by the ""Form realm"", which does contain a subtle physical form, and then the ""desire realm"" where we are. To add to the complexity of this, there are multiple planes of existence within each of these realms in which beings, whose number, like the universe, is infinite, reside according to the karmic relationship of the cause-and-effect nature of consciousness and matter. 

Now for the relationship to the unfolding of cosmic inflation and the big bang. It is said that our universe, being one of infinite, is formed in stages from elements going from subtle to gross; begining with ""wind"" and settling into ""earth."" The ""winds"" churning, or power, or formation, is dependent on and has a direct relationship with consciousnesses in the formless realm. This wind, in turn,  creates fire, creating water, and then finally earth. Where t=0 in the formation of the universe only ""winds,"" and likewise formless beings,  were present driving inflation and evolution of the universe to the point where conditions for each successive element to form; the very hot dense beginning being fire, then water, then stars and planets corresponding to the element of earth. Each stage, likewise, becomes the physical conditions needed for the individual consciousness from the various realms to reside; as the universe formation evolves so too do its conscious inhabitants.

SO what is dark matter and energy?

I propose, and i am just saying this to spark imagination and possibility:

Dark matter = The beings and other physical planes or dimensions in the universe that we are not able to (and my never be able to) detect 

Dark energy = The forces and interrelationship of matter and consciousness of the various beings that reside within the universe",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX_1pM64uUk&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@tjlegs6621,2024-03-31 04:03:54,0.0,"We can only see patterns. Looking for dark matter in terms of thinking you'll find some patterns is exactly why you can't ever see it. It has no form, no pattern to it. It's formless and void of all patterning, except for a little disturbance in it - Our entire universe.

Even our material universe is not what it appears to you. All you're doing is recognizing the patterns that formless energy is making. Like the whirlpool in a river is just a pattern the flow of water is making. There's no such thing as a whirlpool, really. Same goes for everything else in our universe. Material, matter, isn't really there at all. None of it.

Dark matter is right there in front of your eyes, but you don't see it. That's what something with no form at all looks like. There you go, mystery solved. You won't find it in terms of form. We rely 100% on recognition of forms and patterns to see anything and everything. It's not invisible really, that's simply what something looks like that has no form or pattern. It's anti-form, if you will.

That's the state of the universe you know and see before the big bang, or big expansion. Formless, void. And formless and patternless appears to us as nothing, but it's not nothing. A little disturbance occurred in that formless void, which is still there by the way, that set off a little bit of patterning, and gave birth to form, and voila our known universe was here. But the pre-universe stuff is still there, and you call it the mysterious dark energy. It's no mystery at all. What is it then? Well, it's ""that"". Even asking the question what is it, is silly. Like asking what happened a millisecond before the big bang is a silly question. Nothing happened, and there was no millisecond before.

Furthermore, you'll never find the basic stuff that material is made of, because you can only see patterns. The basic stuff, no matter how powerful of a microscope you may invent, will never find it. Because it's simply not there. It will infinitely escape your observation because you're looking for forms and patterns, of course you are, because that's all we can see or detect. We're patterns looking only for other patterns. And to us patterns, something void and without pattern, appears to us as nothing. And correctly so, it is nothing. But nothing is something.

Same if you try to observe the macroscopic, it will infinitely escape your observation in the same way as the microscopic does. The only way for us to observe the macroscopic though, is in the imagination of the mind. And yes, it escapes our observation in the imagination also.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iA7wZfxglE&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-24 20:32:37,0.0,"It (dark matter) is much more than speculation. After dealing with the wild speculation of alternative visions of gravity, dark matter seems down right simple to understand.
We can't see it at distances of galactic halos and ancient inclusions deep inside regular matter.
The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

I love your videos and your explanations because you don't offer just one explanation. You show the others and explain why they fall short.
However, something doesn't quite add up with the idea of dark matter for me and raises a question.

We know definitively that planetary systems exist within galaxies.
 
If Dark Matter does as well and is also responsible for the rotational curve of galaxies, then why do planetary systems not exhibit the same rotational curve?

Wouldn't dark matter also have the same effect on them?

Perhaps I'm missing something here but it just seems illogical to me that dark matter (if it exists at all) would be so prolific that it could manipulate the rotational curve of an entire galaxy which is comprised of millions of stars and the planetary systems that orbit them.
Yet, at the same time, it wouldn't have the same effect on the planetary systems themselves?

I know the theory claims that this is due to the localized density of a planetary system and because of this dark matter would be diffused.
But that kind of defies logic and this them means that the theory directly contradicts itself because if dark matter passes right through everything and doesn't interact with it then why would it concern itself with local densities? 
More importantly how can something that doesn't interact with anything including itself cluster in the first place?

This problem just has me really scratching my head regarding this subject matter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iA7wZfxglE&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

This would be the outer space that surrounds all inner space. As the inner space is condenced and the space between is squeezed,action reaction occured and the space outside the area of mass,inner space expands and the area between expands as well. Inner space has less force when expanded but the space in between now has more influence. An object wants to take the path of least resistance and when it encounters this area in space,it follows this path. It gradually comes under the influence of the space condenced by mass. I think there should be a relation with the layers of the sun to the orbits of the planets,as each element layer condenced space differently within the whole.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iA7wZfxglE&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

The miniscule force that holds together observable particles is an electronic attraction. We generally rely on the charge of particles to detect them, so if dark matter has no charge like mentioned in the video, they would not be caught by any ordinary means. Something else must be holding them together then, and as our understanding of physics evolves, researchers have found that electromagnetic fields and gravity work in ways that are nearly mathematically identical. It is entirely possible that the primary source holding dark matter particles together is gravity instead of electromagnetism, which could also explain why these illusive pieces of mass seem to hold unique gravitational properties.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iA7wZfxglE&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

They came up with dark matter, which creates additional gravity and allows galaxies to rotate so quickly.
But they can't find this dark matter.
What if there is no dark matter?
Maybe there another interaction of matter on large scales?
Weaker than gravity, but even longer-range. Let's say its strength decreases not as the square of the distance, but less.
Because of this, on a small scale, such as the solar system, its influence is imperceptible due to its insignificant micropower.
But on the scale of galaxies, over many tens of light years, this force is more powerful than gravity due to a more significant weakening of the gravitational force.
Following the example of strong and weak nuclear interaction: there can also be strong and weak gravitational interaction.
This could explain why galaxies rotate faster than gravity allows.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@voiceofkanaan2572,2024-06-03 20:58:48,0.0,"Dark matter is basically what the Allah described in the Quran in verse (25:45). We constantly describe reality around us according to our own eyes, but this is flawed understanding because God was, is the only eternal entity there is and anything else including the darkness of space, and shadows are created  from nothing, which is what creating means. Meaning the shadows we see, the darkness that is in space were not originally there and ""not eternal"" to begin with. Therefore we cannot say the space and darkness is nothing and we cannot say it is being created ""by"" nothing rather ""from"" nothing.

This verse about the reality of shadows God exactly mentioned after talking about how people depend solely on their minds to be guided about the meaning of life to tell you that, just like the empirically untouchable shadows, your thought process is also invisible to you but it is still a non-eternal thing that was created and unless you follow the word of God which is revealed to humans by prophets completely as is and unchanged ""the pure word of the lord"", you cannot be guided. 

Bottom line is, you cannot depend on a created thing to be guided to the uncreated ""God"" because you will constantly fall victim to the whims of the relativity of the human mind. (just like they though that the shadow is the absence of light when darkness is really a created thing that covers everything and expands and contracts in synchrony with light).

The theory makes testable predictions that physicists are investigating now.
Now
If you need 6 strings to be matter and there is only 5 strings those 5 strings never pop into our dimensions as matter.
Those 5 stings continuously try to be matter in our dimension but fail continuously. 
The 5 strings may be considered virtual matter never to become matter in our dimension but actually produce a force in our dimension. Thus dark energy.

Dark Matter is failed strings attempting to come into existence in our dimensions
Dark Energy is failed strings creating forces in our dimensions attempting to come into existence in our dimensions.

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-15 05:12:28,0.0,"The dark matter model is strange.
It is strongly connected to the quarks of the standard model of particle physics.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@BrianCStratton,2023-08-12 21:01:57,0.0,"I would like to begin admitting I am an ignorant human but nonetheless very curiuos as well.

I know this may not sit well with physicists but I would like to present a very limited understanding of Buddhist cosmology because this presentation takes into account both the physical realms of the universe and non-physical realms of consciousness and may shed some inkling of insight into the ""matter."" 

Just as there are multiple planes or levels of consciousness that we can experience correspondingly, according to Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple planes in which consciousness can reside. Ths most subtle being the ""Formless realm"" where, as the name implies, there is no physical form yet consciousness resides. This is followed by the ""Form realm"", which does contain a subtle physical form, and then the ""desire realm"" where we are. To add to the complexity of this, there are multiple planes of existence within each of these realms in which beings, whose number, like the universe, is infinite, reside according to the karmic relationship of the cause-and-effect nature of consciousness and matter. 

Now for the relationship to the unfolding of cosmic inflation and the big bang. It is said that our universe, being one of infinite, is formed in stages from elements going from subtle to gross; begining with ""wind"" and settling into ""earth."" The ""winds"" churning, or power, or formation, is dependent on and has a direct relationship with consciousnesses in the formless realm. This wind, in turn,  creates fire, creating water, and then finally earth. Where t=0 in the formation of the universe only ""winds,"" and likewise formless beings,  were present driving inflation and evolution of the universe to the point where conditions for each successive element to form; the very hot dense beginning being fire, then water, then stars and planets corresponding to the element of earth. Each stage, likewise, becomes the physical conditions needed for the individual consciousness from the various realms to reside; as the universe formation evolves so too do its conscious inhabitants.

SO what is dark matter and energy?

I propose, and i am just saying this to spark imagination and possibility:

Dark matter = The beings residing on other planes in the universe that we are not able to (and my never be able to) detect 

Dark energy = The forces and interrelationship of matter and consciousness of the various beings that reside within the universe",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@anuragb.9349,2024-12-03 07:52:00,0.0,"I have been reading about the dark matter since the last two decades. Just a disclaimer, I am not a trained astrophysicist. Sometimes, some scientists explain it in the way of ""exotic"" matter that cannot be detected via conventional or latest technology at hand but can be deduced by the way it interacts with its surroundings and affects them like gravitational lensing etc. After the failure of the CERN experiments to reproduce or detect the dark matter, scientists went back to saying its just matter that cannot be seen.

I remember up until late 1980s,  the astronomers around the world were baffled by the deviations in the calculated  orbits of Uranus and Neptune. This led the astronomers to believe that there was another massive planet beyond Uranus snd Neptune that was exerting its gravitional pull on these outer planets. When Voyager II visited Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989, the masses of the planets were calculated again from the data obtained from the spacecraft and their orbits were calculated again the voila, the discrepancies ir deviations in their orbits disappeared. 

So from our Earth based observations, we erroneously calculated the wrong masses of these planets leading to discrepancies in their orbits, leading the astronomers to hypothesize about the existence of another giant planet, which was never there.

Once telescopes got good enough to tell that normal matter was not the cause of the problem the term Dark Matter should have died.

@TheColinfrank,2024-06-02 07:40:17,0.0,"Hi Sabine. My friends and I love your presentations. Your no-nonsense, ???????????? approach is such a breath of fresh air compared to the numerous, overzealous, high-profile Youtube defenders of science (no names mentioned) whose tenor, in my opinion, tends toward hyperbole, propaganda, and fanatical evangelism, not to mention an abysmal simple-mindedness due to ignorance of the philosophy of science, often resulting in gross distortion.

I'd just like to remark on the following:

4:25: ""And that's why the dark matter theory has become so controversial. Because for all practical purposes it's become impossible to falsify.""

You say this as if unfalsifiability singles out dark matter theory for particular opprobrium among scientific theories, making it the black sheep (pardon the pun), as it were, of an otherwise respectable family of falsifiable theories.

I'm not sure whether you're aware -- and frequent pronouncements of high profile scientists to the contrary notwithstanding -- that philosophers of science have been arguing, I think compellingly, for many decades now that ?????? scientific theories are unfalsifiable, at least in any definitive or logical sense. Your viewers might refer, for example, to the work of Thomas Kuhn, Larry Laudan, and in particular, Imre Lakatos.

The reason for this is often explained by the so-called Duhem-Quine thesis, and the ???????????????? nature of scientific testing. It's really rather common-sensical. When observation or experimental results do not sit comfortably with theory, we are not compelled by logic to the conclusion that the theory is false. The scientist always has the option of positing a previously unknown planet or subatomic particle to account for the discrepancy, she might add a few epicycles here and there, she might conjure up kin selection and inclusive fitness to account for altruism in the animal kingdom, he might add a cosmological constant. Why, they might even conjure up dark matter!

None of this sits very easily with the frequent pronouncements of high profile scientists such as Richard Dawkins to the effect that a single unexpected result -- a Precambrian rabbit perhaps -- would immediately sound the death knell for ?????? theory of evolution, whatever that is this week. Neither does it make easy bedfellows with the often heard doctrine that falsifiability is precisely the ?????????????????????? criterion which distinguishes scientific claims from religious or pseudoscientific claims.

In passing I'd point out the obvious fact that scientific theories do, of course, sometimes fall from grace. Equally obvious, I trust, is that it does not follow from the fact of a theory being abandoned that it was ???????????????????????? ??????????????????. Perhaps scientists simply moved on to something they found preferable, for whatever reasons. Indeed, the history of science tends to show a slow, gradual death until no one is left alive to defend a theory (e.g. phlogiston, aether), as opposed to a critical moment when it immediately becomes obvious to all concerned that the theory is false. Need I remind anyone of Max Planck's famous observation on this?

Albert Einstein, always insightful and ahead of his time, wrote the following:

""For it is often, perhaps even always, possible to adhere to a general theoretical foundation by securing the adaptation of the theory to the facts by means of artificial additional assumptions""

""Artificial"" sounds like the way you view the attempts to keep dark matter theory alive, Sabine. Of course, what might appear artificial or ???? ?????? to one scientist may not appear that way to another. Presumably the defenders of dark matter theory see their salvage attempts as perfectly valid, indeed is it not the case that dark matter was introduced in the first place in order to salvage general relativity from anomalous observations?

Was it ???? ?????? or artificial, for example, for defenders of the Copernican theory to declare that the fixed stars must be at an inconceivable distance from us in order to account for the lack of observed stellar parallax?

I am of the mind that gravity is governed by a particle, like every other force, or you all just misunderstand the mechanics of gravity. 

You see it as a warping of space time, but those models dont work without dark matter. Gravity ia more like a spiders web than a whirlpool. Its force pulls on eveything around it, yet the pull is felt event billions of miles away, yet, other strings pull in different directions, at all.times with different levels of force. 

The collective network of objects all pulling on each other is what dark matter is.

An idea derived from string theory suggests that dark matter is hiding in a (relatively) large extra dimension. 
The theory makes testable predictions that physicists are investigating now.
Now
If you need 6 strings to be matter and there is only 5 strings that 5 strings never pop into our dimensions as matter.
Those 5 stings continuously try to be matter in our dimension but fail continuously. 
The 5 strings may be considered virtual matter never to become matter in our dimension but actually produce a force in our dimension. Thus dark energy.
So
Dark Matter is failed strings attempting to come into existence in our dimensions
Dark Energy is failed strings creating forces in our dimensions attempting to come into existence in our dimensions.
Failed Strings are everywhere and continuous pop in and pop out of our dimension",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpKZ8HI6Ixc&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-14 04:52:03,0.0,"Dear Sabine Hossenfelder, 
 On the subject of dark matter.
The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpKZ8HI6Ixc&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

But.. some of the stars we see in the sky are so far away that they've gone supernova a billion years ago. Aren't they not taking into account the fact that we are looking into the past and every star around us is just an older snapshot of what the planet looked like when the light started traveling to us. So our picture of what the universe looks like gets progressively less accurate the further we look. So why isn't this ""dark stuff"" just the galaxies and solar systems as they are now, which we won't see for billions of years? It sounds like they're trying to plug in extra stuff like say.. ""solar system a"" has an invisible ring of mass around it and that explains the extra mass we detect. But maybe ""solar system a"" had collided with solar system d 1 billion years ago and through that process has changed properties or the black hole somehow got dragged away by and merged into bigger one and now there is less entropy or something.

@altrag,2024-02-02 21:34:55,0.0,"Dark matter is wrong.  GR is wrong.  MOND is wrong.  QM is wrong.  We know this, because gravity doesn't play well with the standard model.

Of course ""wrong"" in this context is not as absolute as it sounds.  All of those theories work as good approximations under certain assumptions (low energies, large distances, etc) just like we still use Newtonian mechanics and not full blown GR to describe apples falling - an apple just isn't heavy enough for the approximation error difference between Newton and Einstein's theories to matter.

Of course plenty of the wild ""well maybe its ..."" hypothesis surrounding dark matter will absolutely be wrong.  They're all just shots in the dark (pun fully intended) and most come with exactly zero evidence beyond ""we can make the math work if we tweak it hard enough in a manner that conveniently agrees with our hypothesis"".

Also, there's a very large gap between finding new solutions to Einstein's equations (general relativity is _extremely_ general - there are countless possible solutions) vs actually tweaking the equations.  Its absolutely valid to use specific data points when coming up with a specific solution, just like its valid to inject values for ""m"" and ""a"" and get a specific ""F"" in Newton's equation.  Of course we prefer solutions where we can parameterize the data points in order to allow the solution to apply to a larger number of situations, but its not actually required.  Its the difference between plugging in a constant mass for ""F=ma"" and reducing the equation to just ""F=ca"" to get a ""general"" solution for forces related to a specific mass (for example, the force of gravity on Earth is usually only written with the 'a' part with the 'm' being held constant as the mass of our planet), vs plugging in both a constant mass and a known acceleration to get an exact answer for a single specific data point.

Tweaking the equations themselves is a whole other ball game though, and much much more difficult to justify.  Einstein himself tried to do that when he added a constant to his GR equations, which he later described infamously as his ""biggest blunder"" (of course being Einstein, he wasn't entirely wrong - that added constant went on to become the cosmological constant which describes the expansion of the universe - but his _reason_ for adding it was absolutely wrong).

That's not to say the equations can't be tweaked.  Just that if you do so you have to be _extremely_ careful not just in your mathematics but also in your purpose.  Much more careful than you need to be if you're just coming up with a new solution to the base equations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpKZ8HI6Ixc&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

This is no periodic table with actual points in it that you can nicely fit in a form of energy and matter.
The ripples in the formation of the universe are just ripples in the fabric of the universe that is all quantum in nature. 
The apparent acceleration of the universe is not more than a ripple in space, and while I'm on it, won't mention time, as time does NOT exist... it is simply a mechanism created by man to make large scale calculations possible with our limited math ability. It's like a wave reaching the shores and getting bigger and apparently having more affect  on the surrounds... but it's just a ripple.
If you think that space is expanding faster and faster, then it must reach a point at some stage in the future where it can no longer support the quantum nature of matter and at that point everything will instantly disappear... and well, I'm fairly sure that is not going to happen.
There will never be a theory of everything, because there can be no theory that will work on the level of a Universe, and then down at the field level of the universe.

I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.
But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.
That's because gravity is not a force.
Gravity is just a joint effect of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.
Details are given below.

Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1, ?2, ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter. Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.

@peter4210,2023-04-20 01:36:46,2.0,"TLDR:
Dark matter is a theoretical magical matter that was invented over 100 years ago by some guy who applied newtons law while looking at a galaxy and realized that the outer most objects were not spinning around the galactic center as slow as orbital mechanics dictated. They did move at the right speed if the guy toke into account that the galaxy was heavier then he estimated the weight to be at. To him, fudging the numbers to get the right answer meant that the problem was that he was not seeing the missing matter instead of assuming the math to be wrong. Because maths in a era they had not gone to the moon yes was obviously not flawed, he theorized that there is somehow a dark, invisible form of matter. 

Modern dark matter believers say that over 70% of the universe matter is dark matter, how every they are not able to detect or prove that it exist. 
In essence dark matter is the modern version of ""i dont understand lighting, therefore it is god who is angry"".

Currently there is a lot of scientist who are working with models to fix the equation that we use for gravity. In essence fixing the math instead of inventing something that clearly does not exist. Turns out, most of these works require just a minute adjustment, Sadly, the belief in dark matter which goes against the scientific principle is so encrusted now that to prove the dark matter believers wrong, their mathematical formula has to essentially also account for all the dumb shit they also say is the work of dark matter which is ridiculous since they basically have to prove the earth is round and as far as we know also show that the same proof explains why the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, too things that as far as we know are unrelated except they have no proof.

@ronaldkemp3952,2023-02-14 20:01:11,0.0,"I've got a general question for ya.

Dark matter is blamed on the extra motion occurring to our solar system as it orbits around the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.  We're traveling at a velocity of around 536,000 mi/h.  But according to general relativity and the laws of motion because we're located some 26,000 light years from the barycenter, we're supposed to be traveling at about 90,000 mi/h.  There is a discrepancy of around 450,000 mi/h between what was measured and what was predicted.  The extra motion is pinned on dark matter.

My question, if dark matter was causing the sun to be traveling so fast, 450,000 mi/h then why doesn't it affect the motion of the Earth, planets and other small bodies as they orbit the sun?  

According to the laws of motion matter falls at the same rate, regardless of weight or density.  A bowling ball and a feather fall at the same rate in a vacuum.  This was proven many times before.  So if the sun is being affected by dark matter, and the gravity produced by this missing mass is the only force acting upon visible matter, then why is the Earth, planets and other small bodies not affected?  They should be affected just like the sun and all other stars and satellite galaxies orbiting the central black hole.  

But dark matter doesn't affect the motion and orbits of planets and moons.  Why is that?  If the mass of dark matter particles were acting upon the sun causing it to move 450,000 mi/h too fast, then why doesn't it affect the motion of the planets and moons too?  Planets and moons would be much closer to the dark matter halo than the sun. They should be affected too as they orbit around the sun, more so than the sun.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDMOHLZtYLM&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

The constellation Ursa Major, the Great Bear, is an opened star cluster, all its stars are the same age and with similar chemistry, so what made a star cluster fly apart? surely they should spend eternity in each others orbits with perhaps one or two stars being hurled out resulting in the cluster tightening but thats not what has happened, the stars are flying apart.

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-22 19:16:30,1.0,"Dark matter in small quantities starts the production of planets and stars. Entire stars made only of dark matter are rare. Nearly every star has a lot of dark matter at its center. Discovery of dark matter will be soon. 
It depends on the speed of space exploration and development.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

Maybe one of these days, if we manage to achieve absolute zero temp, we will have enough understanding to predict quantum fluctuations, predict the future, and have a solid understanding of how the universe functions from tip to butt, including gravity.

Einstein formulated an improved theory of gravity.  It works for all practical applications of our time.  It is more complicated, but still elegant, even more stupendously accurate, and is easily shown to be consistent under a much wider variety of experimental conditions.  It also manages to account for the inconsistencies of the previous theory at those much larger scales.  But at even greater scales, unimaginable scales, it ceases to predict the effects of gravity adequately...

I wonder what might be needed.  Is there some historical precedent we might look to?

Oh, I know:  a conjured exotic particle whose characteristics are without precedent, and whose existence can neither be verified nor disproved with any conceivable experiment or observation.

Ive heard theories, Einstein was probably the closest to reality of anybody. But even if we understand gravity, who says thats the only thing holding it together? A SPACE STORM. Think about it. If atoms in gas here on earth can be so highly energized, as to cause a hurricane, a tornado, and thats just hot and cold gas. Not very dense. Not much power when compared to higher pressure higher temperature matter in deep space. A cold dense center like a supermassive black hole surrounded by a gaseous star matter swirling around it sounds like a SPACE STORM to me. Our missing matter (MASS) hypothesized is really and truly ENERGY. Still equivalent. A storm produces FORCE. That galaxy holds together by thermodynamics.  Thats my idea.

@hudsonbakke8836,2023-11-21 04:41:44,0.0,"In my opinion, as someone who isn't a physicist but just someone who studies and appreciates physics, what we call ""dark matter"" isn't a thing at all. It's a name we give to something that can account for the errors in our calculations based on the relativistic model of the universe. It could be a real, physical substance, however I personally think it's far more likely that ""dark matter"" simply arises in our calculations due to a fundamental incompleteness in our mathematical model of gravity. This is exactly what lead to the development of general relativity in the first placefor centuries people used Newton's law of gravitation because it was perfect at describing gravitation at a small scale, however as people began peering more and more into the cosmos, and trying to use Newton's law to predict the motion of celestial bodies, they began to realize that there was always a small but significant error in their calculations, and that's when Einstein created general relativity as a mathematical framework to correct for that error and make better predictions about the motion of planets and stars. I think what we are discovering with ""dark matter"" is the same thing that Einstein discovered when analyzing the orbit of Mercury. The current mathematical model we have is really really good, practically indistinguishable from perfect for predictions on the scale of solar systems, however when you scale up to an entire galaxy, that model becomes more and more inaccurate and we will need a new model to correct for that error. Importantly, Einstein did not ""disprove"" Newton when he invented general relativity. Newton's law of gravitation becomes more and more accurate the smaller and smaller scale you measure across. All Einstein did was show that Newton's law, while correct in a way, was just incomplete, and generalized it to a much larger context. In the same way, I don't think dark matter disproves relativity. Rather, relativity is a model that becomes more and more accurate on smaller and smaller scales, and it's not that it's *wrong* on larger scales per se; it's just incomplete. Maybe some future mathematician and physicist will come up with a new model to generalize relativity to the scale of entire galaxies, thus obsoleting the concept of dark matter entirely.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUhOL38346Y&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@NaturalFuture,2024-03-18 20:05:13,0.0,"Is there really such a thing as ""normal"" matter? Where'd educated people get that expression, anyway--from the Simpsons? Sounds very cartoonish, and used by those who are too lazy to find the most precise name for something they don't quite understand. Here's what I call it, based on what logic and language strongly suggest:  Visible matter, or v-matter. Why's that? Because it's visible. As for its opposite--the form of matter which supposedly exists but that you can't see, it shouldn't be called ""dark"" matter, but rather invisible matter, or i-matter. When you deal with two things in opposition (say, top v. bottom) but change to two terms that aren't in opposition (top v. left), it throws the entire description out of balance.

Moreover, how can just one be called normal? Does that make so-called ""dark"" matter abnormal? But, how can that be when scientists say that visible (aka ""normal"" matter) makes up 26% of the universe while ""dark"" matter makes up 5% of the cosmos? Obviously, both are normal. Yet, one is of a type you can easily detect, the other of a type that's difficult. (The way these people give the two types of matter names, they might as well, respectively, call one ""easy"" matter, for 'easy to detect'; and the other ""difficult"" matter, because it's difficult to detect.) What about ""dark"" energy? Is that abnormal, simply because it's hard to detect? How can that be whe when scientists say the cosmos is made of 69% of it? Interesting how language can be misused, and misleading.

Thus, you can see how the version I propose is logical, precise, and enlightening. Yes, the form of matter--and energy--that we can find, see, and understand with relative ease should be called ""visible,"" while the type that's difficult to find, see, and understand should be called ""invisible"" matter and energy.

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-19 21:33:02,0.0,"Dark matter isn't a fiction.
It just needs to square itself topologically and with appropriate math and physics.
It's not all that hard.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

If a hurricane or tornado can be mustered up by mere air, how much force would a SUPER MASSIVE BLACK HOLE and surrounding gaseous stars swirling around a common center like Sagittarius A STAR. Heat always travels from a warmer substance to a colder one. Thats the law. A hot object will heat a cold one. If the cold one is big enough, it will simply rob the heat instantly. If its slow, it will radiate and conduct if its touching, and convection if theres a stark contrast in temperatures. What holds the galaxy together isnt extra mass, its FORCE from energized stars force circling the black hole at our center. This completely gets rid of any need for HIDDEN MASS. Now, Im sure there are condensate materials that give off no visible light waves or rays. So there may be some extra mass unaccounted for. But the true reason it doesnt fly apart, is that IT IS A STORM. And its ok, we still need you guys to keep grinding out math. But sometimes the math lies. Like a singularity and infinite density. All that means is ALL POSSIBLE FUTURES POINT TO THE BIG DENSE MASS. It stops time and locks out empty space that belongs in a cores volume. Expansion by displacement. Each mass is a GROWTH that must be gone around. Creating gravity and blowing out the edge. If we sink a beach ball into a pool representing SPACE TIME and MATTER. Masses swell the greater volume if space. When we began with the BIG BANG we were hot and dense. Now we have all this stuff that TAKES UP SPACE. The universe has to grow as far as it needs to equal all the mass we find out there! However much matter we contain in our universe, the universe has to grow THAT MUCH to even it out. All of the matter we see in deep space like 200 billion light years and more, is in the past. We might be seeing it now, because its light is finally reaching us. But it could be gone. Like a smoke screen carcass of what used to be. Were on such a microcosm point of view, that things that happen instantly on the MACRO SCALE appear to us as OBECTS still there.

@eytansuchard8640,2023-11-24 17:43:06,0.0,"There is a model in which energy is described by non-geodesic accelerations of scalar fields. The first such scalar field is a Geroch time function. It is used to describe the electromagnetic field and concludes that not only the energy of the electric field generates gravity but also it's divergence does. The acceleration is an unusual Reeb Class vector, not the ordinary Reeb vector. There is an offer of how the generalize the theory to other force fields. The energy of the electric field is stored in a weak acceleration field, 8.61 cm/sec^2 for 1000000 volts/1mm but due to charge gravity, it is lower, 4.305cm/sec^2. The outcome is a surprise, charge itself generates gravity and anti-gravity, (-,+)5.802135 *10^9 Kg/Coulomb. Charge is coupled with a non geodesic bivector but the divergence of the energy momentum tensor does vanish. This cannot be used in a high voltage capacitor to generate a Hermann Bondi inertial dipole due to the dielectric layer's anti-alignment of induced dipoles. There must be a solution, however, that will reach a breakthrough propulsion technology. Positively charged gas and dust can account for part of the Dark Matter effect and intergalactic electrons can account for part of the Dark Energy effect.

@Sauron191,2023-11-16 12:53:06,0.0,"Matt, can you answer me this question please. When considering our sun is a G-Type main sequence star with an Oort Cloud of a given scale, volume and mass, would it be fair to theorise that at least most of all the other G-type stars within our galaxy would have one too? (And possibly consider a vast majority of stars of any type would have also) Is all this extra mass (which Id presume to be only an extremely small fraction of whats needed to dismiss the presence of dark matter given the effects observed in galactic rotation curves).. But given the predicted volume of space occupied by a given Oort could this would make the volume of empty space as it were between stars would be vastly reduced. IF we considered a given stars volume in space to end at the outer surface of its Oort Cloud, meaning that the individual masses of stars (Including any orbiting planets, possible asteroid & Kyper belts and its Oort Cloud etc) and combine all that mass would that not even it out a bit more? 

Also when moving into the centre of a galaxy stars become more concentrated, gravitational effects on each other are bigger etc could factors such as the extreme heat, radiation etc turn these inner stars hypothetical Oort clouds into gas which then gets thrown out into the outer arms of our spiral galaxy by centrifugal interactions (meaning the heavier stars get pulled in by the intense gravity at the core, occupying the space and the lighter gas being ejected to settle down in the outer arms) .. Could this extra matter between all the billions of stars have an effect on what we see? Does Astro physics, galaxy rotation behaviour take this into account? Im 100% sure you all do .. Could you possibly explain your predictions/theories on that? For example how much mass does billions of Oort clouds add to the combined mass of a galaxy and if it negates (If any) a given calculated mass presence needed by dark matter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6OmgXi1C-I&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

Like a sort of resonance or self inductance where the effect of gravity is governed by more than just the amount of stuff there is. After all we still dont really understand the origin of gravity.

@peters616,2023-10-19 18:09:35,0.0,"After watching an interview with Dr. Kroupa on why dark matter cannot exist, at least in massive halos surrounding galaxies, I took a look at his 2012 paper, The Dark Matter Crisis: Falsification of the Current Standard Model of Cosmology.  He found interactions between galaxies preclude the presence of a dark matter halo, which, if present would have a friction-like effect that would slow visible matters interaction, but that effect was not observed at all.  According to Dr. Kroupa, DM halos have been falsified to a 5 signma confidence.  I'm not sure if any of these proposed modifications to DM you mention in the video address that falsification, or you have some other reason to doubt Dr. Kroupa's work on this subject, but if so I would like to hear it.  He believes that Dr. Milgrom's MOND is a better explanation for the rotation of galaxies.  There are problems with MOND, such as gravitational lensing and bullet clusters, but I've seen some efforts to harmonize those observations with a version of MOND.  For one thing, bullet clusters may be explainable if there is baryonic matter like dust and black holes, than we just can't see (something like an additional 50 percent matter) under MOND without the need for any dark matter.

Would also explain dark energy as simply being the incomprehensible distant gravitational pull of super-clusters competing around us ""for us"" and dragging us apart.

Matter always sinks into its place on the mat of spacetime, perpetually, stretching the fabric in between. Which then stretches exponentially.

The observable universe is only the event horizon of our gravitational sinkhole, just going down without end for eternity.

It also explains how satellites have a stable orbit, they sink into their own endless gravitational well as fast as the thing they orbit pulls them which counteracts the gravitational 'sinking' of thr satellite.

What I'm trying to say is that mass is only internally stable. It is dynamically ""increasing"" all the time, but this only manifests on the scale that is in-between galaxy clusters. And it is how masses 'pull' at all: things only attract each-other because they're inside each other's gravitational sinkhole, it's also why gravity expands, while it ""reaches out"" it also sinks deeper.

This would also mean that black holes travel faster and faster into the future, and so do we. And this would mean the space in-between clusters that is being stretched is temporally slowing downbecause it experiences negative mass by being stretched in the reverse way that black holes increase in mass.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6OmgXi1C-I&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

No, we need to audit the existing models and not simply fabricate the existence of a substance solely based on it's existence making the models work better.  Based on the scientific method, it's existence can be hypothesized based on it working to improve the model but before it can become theory, a bunch of tests and experiments must be done to positively detect and confirm its existence.  Instead, it seems scientists changed the order.  Calling its existence a theory solely based on it making the math work and performed experiments later.  Experiments that have all failed to prove its existence.  Perhaps the problem that scientists want dark matter to be the answer for is actually the result of flawed model (flawed math)?

So if you feel like you are being attracted to the earth it is more like you are being pushed onto the earth like standing under a water fall . The universe is like a huge water tank full of water and matter is like tiny holes in that tank and the black holes are like the pumps pumping water back into the tank and like the water going down a bathtub drain you get the spiral you get the same with the solar systems and galaxies. The more time that is released from matter in the black holes you get an expanding universe and once a black hole runs low on fuel or matter it would probably explode and as mass absorbed time the universe would be contracting until the time is converted back into matter creating a lot of matter that accumulates to the point that it becomes a black hole again and it starts all over again .

Consider instead that it is gravitational time dilation which causes the outer stars to only appear to be orbiting faster, this being due to their distance from the super massive black hole in the center. The stars orbiting closer to the center of the galaxy are experiencing a slower pace of gravitational time dilation than stars orbiting farther away from the center. The stars which are farthest away from the center are actually orbiting at the correct speed according to Einsteins field equations, except they only appear to rotate faster because the orbiting stars can be viewed as a giant galactic clock which is ticking off time faster for the outer stars than it does for the inner stars, all due to gravitational time dilation which depends on the distance from the supermassive black hole which all the stars orbit around. The inner stars are standing in a stronger gravitational field than the outer stars and experience a slowing of their clocks. The galactic clock ticks off time much slower for inner stars. The outer stars experience a speeding up of their clocks because theyre so far away from the strong gravitational field nearer the center mass of the galaxy, and so the galactic clock ticks off time faster for the outer stars. This makes the outer stars appear to be orbiting too fast. We should actually expect to see the stars appear to move overly fast on the outskirts of spiral galaxies where gravity is weaker than near the center.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6OmgXi1C-I&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-14 04:56:21,0.0,"Dear Sabine, 
Here's what I think.
See if you agree.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_qJptwikRc&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

M=E/C2. so the problem becomes describing the source, nature and carácter of the energy. look at the map of world Oceanic flow patterns and everywhere you look there are eddies spinning off the main currents, such that a snapshot would show almost as many bodies of water spinning on them selves as those that have a distinct coarse like the ""Conveyor Belt"" ,""Humboldt currant"" etc.

  If as I propose Axions still swirling about in an ""Ongoing Bang"" or more accurately the continuing expansion of the universe then this energy (Fluid mass, therefore fluid gravitational influences), not only explains the missing overall mass but the early formations of over densities of mass in the early universe ""Massive Galaxy clusters etc"".(All without changing the gravitational constant)

I think the most important part of my idear is the creation of cavitations' in the cosmos . The vacuums that are INEVITABLY created when too much energy hits a fluid.  These 'vacuums'  are the 'secondary Couse of acceleration AFTER the energy event that caused them'. As such they are my explanation of why the Universe is accelerating as it is, at different speeds in different places.
I am not academic so don't pretend to understand all the theories you mentioned but apart from the concept of flow(Gravitationally) I am biasing it purely on well established science.
To test my idear I would suggest that there should be ""Venturian""  flow patterns in ""Galaxy groups"".

@Human_01,2023-07-21 22:32:24,0.0,"ORIGIN-OF-ENERGY [UNIVERSE/DIMENSION]

As Einstein proposed: ""energy is neither created nor destroyed."" 

Energy is the basis of the perceivable universe. Energy exists in countless variations/forms. The qualities of the expanse of energy, as well as the intrinsic properties of it's physical form/outer layer is what dictates a 'type' of energy. 

In quantum mechanics, energy can be observed and scaled in terms of size. They range from the universal to the subatomic/quantum. The smallest of which includes dark matter and dark energy. These are some of the simplest forms of energy/""life"" (conceptual context; energy is core of motion/life. Life is the complex 'regulated-energy-system' that hints at ""intelligent-design""). The correlation between the regulation[system] of energy in a given space or object, and the 'extent'/quantifiable-unit (like Gigabyte or 'storage-unit' of measurement) of the perceivable intelligent-design/consciousness is absolute (i.e. they are undoubtedly related. A kind of Efficiency measuring unit can be created quantify ""life""/extent of ""intelligent-design""). Intelligent-design is life in every context (it hints at it), e.g. even the layered structure of the sun, all the way to cells in the body, and placement of gravitational body's in our solarsytem how's varying levels of regulated-energy-system (courtesy of ""intelligent design""; a conscious-force that regulates and designed our conscious-universe).

Since energy cannot be created nor destroyed, and since it can be converted/transformed into various forms, and physically built up or built down(alter properties, e.g. frequency & vibration), then how did energy come into being in the first place? How did it come to occupy the space[medium] that we call the ""universe?"" The answer: is that energy is released from another dimension[dark-matter: filter/layer consisting fabric of reality] and into the dimension we reside inmuch like a pocket that is connected/lined to the outside world. A ""whitehole"" would be example of such an existence.

Diffusion affects dark energy. The dimension pocket it came/leaked from is of a place with a high concentration (of dark energy). That would explain the [similar] moment / behavior that it shares with regular [atomic] particles, e.g. it's tendency to spread, and in a spherical/radiating manner, which indicates it originated from a small point in space. And in the case with diffusion between space of highly different concentration, the initial ""exchange"" is quite ""explosive""; providing high volumes of kinetic energy. The rate of exchange will remain constant depending on the difference/intensity/concentration of dark energy between two spaces. If the rate of dark energy radiation begins to slow down that would imply that the difference in concentration / concentration gradient between two dimensions is reaching equilibrium. In our universe, this would result in the expanse of space so large that atoms wouldn't be able to collide anymore.  

Dark energy would still be leaking into the universe but it would be at a much slower rate, so the literal ""creation process"" would increasingly slow down, e.g. the rate of the birth of a new star would slow down. The result would be a very dull and spacious environment that remains seemingly forever frozen in time. Until one of the concentrated dimensions made contact with a [new] less concentrated one. The greater the difference in concentration between the two the more violent/energetic the explosion of their impact/contact with each other will be, e.g. a more powerful Big Bang. 

Since dark energy is the building blocks of reality, and since it takes up space by radiating within it, and then contracts and compresses to become a denser form of energy, i.e. dark matter (dark-matter is the conscious fabric of space/conscious fabric of reality, and it exists in layers. A black-hole wraps itself in the fabric of space; bending space-time, and by extension dark-matter as well). And eventually becomes a denser form of energy in the form of atoms, and eventually stars, galaxies, and universes...there is a possibility of universes overcrowding (universes are known to attract to each other and merge). 

In such an occasion, were a dimension is pulsing with too many universes (a outerverse-scaled big crunch, i.e. too much material in small space), contraction would occur again (possibly due to increase in gravity), resulting in the compression of denser forms of energy (resembling a red giant), that would then go on to emit and radiate into smaller forms of energy.  These would, again, eventually become dark energy, and it would eventually leak into an other dimension... Repeating the process all over again.

In short, it's a loop. The ""compress, expand, and emit"" process (similarly to a blackholes) seems to be infinite. But the question is what is it that continuously gives said energy direction. Diffusion is one explanation that partly answers this. But why doesn't the dimensions eventually reach equilibrium; to become a space of perpetual stagnation??? 

The answers seems to be that it can't reach equilibrium. because the dimensions keep pulsating (shrinking and expanding) at different rates in relation to each other. When they make contact, like a bubble, a sudden release of dark energy, driven by momentum (caused by diffusion) is made, and it is in the form of an explosion, i.e. the ""big bang."" Neither dimensions is broken or vanishes. Instead the dimension with a smaller concentration gradient is absorbed into the dimension with a larger gradient. The process happens very slowly, i.e. spanning an near-infinite duration of time. But if you looked at the bigger picture by speeding up time, it would likely resemble a ""bubble"" or ""photon"" bursting < i.e. a sudden by relatively less intense transfer of energy>. Except, like the photon or bubble it didn't bursting into nothingness. Instead, it was only transferred into another environment/dimension.

A whitehole would be a ""big bang"" but on a smaller scale. To reiterate, the point of contact between two [bubble] dimensions is comparable to two portals colliding/making contact with each other. When this occurs, the contents of the dimension with a higher concentration gradient, spills out into the dimension with a lower concentration gradient (rate of diffusion). In our dimension, such an occasion will resemble the big bang or a white hole, i.e. a bright burst of energy, that provides much needed momentum to a stagnating dimension-space, creating new and bigger constructs in the form of universes. The difference in concentration gradient is what decides the size of the explosion, i.e. whether it's a big bang or white hole (small blast).",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_qJptwikRc&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

How much of the following is taken into account when looking at the rotation of a galaxy, and postulating dark matter?

The mass of the inner part has potential, or rotational energy. So according to E = mc2, it's heavier than the sum of the masses of its parts.

The inner parts of a galaxy is therefore heavier than the masses of its parts, i.e., it's suns. That must affect the rotations of the suns further out in the galaxy. But how much?

@florh,2023-06-06 20:43:32,0.0,"I'll probably sound ridiculous now, but what I found out about particle physics, is that no matter the theory, the particle is either made up of vibrating strings, or vibrating fields, whatever it is, it's made of energy. The red up quark has energy and vibrates a certain way, the green up quark has energy and vibrates a certain way, the blue down quark has energy and vibrates a certain way, throw a bunch of gluons in the mix with whatever colorcharge they have have energy and vibrate a certain way, the electron in the mix also has energy and vibrates a certain way, and all those energies and vibrations combined, gives us a hydrogen particle (I think), so for me, if I look at that purely as energyfields and how they vibrate, then this entire combination of all that data, that is a tiny little element. You can make muonium too, that particle (?) also has its unique combination of energies that vibrate a certain way.... So my question is, perhaps we cannot see the particle, we can not measure it, but do we have a calculated guess as to which unique combination of energies and vibrations, a dark matter particle could be? Maybe it's a combination that happens during the interactions with the strong force, or weak force? We know probably all feynmann diagrams, how fundamental particles work, which particles are radiated, but maybe a combination of those radiated particles, can give us dark matter (i'm just trying to make a guess, but I suck at explaining), I think my first question was better, do we have a calculated guess as to which unique combination of energies and vibrations a dark matter particle is? The LHC is also planning an update to a detector, giving it a silicone inner core, they were even talking about a 4th dimension, so my best guess is, all our findings will be up for a possible update, in 8 years, when the data of the muon-2 experiment has been compiled and understood, we'll probably need to do an update in physics ever so small or big. So detecting particles, is also going to be more accurate, maybe that's the problem we have now, maybe we try to detect to far from a collision, the particle is already gone before it could be detected.... How many particles are we supposed to find with all the data we have now? 2 left, wasn't there some twin to the higgs? so that makes the graviton and a dark matter particle? What if we found an unknown particle, is that a possibility? though I must admit I never heard of a twin for the higgs, but apparently there is one, I just forgot the name...
Should we think differently about fields? one thing I've wondered is, how much does the temporal in temporal dimension actually mean, that it's temporary or that it's a dimension? For example in m-theory you said that electromagnetism needs 1 dimension, I can only assume this has to be a temporal dimension as long as there is a photon to carry energy on that dimension? It's really hard to believe for me, that any of those tiny little dimensions are spatial, spatial would suggest a lasting dimension, unless the dimensions for gravity because of time are also temporal??? weird questions huh? Well, that's how my head works. Hehe, if you can even send a photon just by lighting a match, I should actually ask when the electromagnetic field actually broke symmetry if it doesn't need that much energy to send a photon, and it was way too hot during EWSB, so did both broke symmetry or just one of them? maybe there is no graviton if gravity is the result of other forces and not a force itself? maybe time broke symmetry and not gravity? anyone postulating timions by any chance, i'm now!!! ????",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_qJptwikRc&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@michaelkahn8744,2023-05-07 19:48:27,0.0,"Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - New model of the Universe can explain ""Dark Matter and Dark Energy""

Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.

However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?

The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1,  ?2,  ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.

The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter.

Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.

Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.

As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_qJptwikRc&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@euclon,2024-06-02 14:42:10,0.0,"Why, when trying to explain the ""missing mass"" in the universe, is energy in translation never mentioned?  When I look at a star for example, there is an electromagnetic connection, if you will, between my eye and that distant star.  My eye is detecting a very minuscule portion of all the energy emitted by that star at some point in the past.  There is an electromagnetic path of mass-converted-to-energy the entire intervening distance from star to eye.   That star, and every other body in the universe that has non absolute zero temperature, is emitting electromagnetic energy of varied frequencies, but emitting none-the-less.  We know that this energy in translation interacts with gravitational fields; bending of light paths etc.  Every emitting body is surrounded by an envelope of energy of rough radius at least as large as it's age in light years.  The energy in translation is ""invisible"" until it reacts with some matter, it is only then that it is detected, that it is revealed.  But what is it's effect on all other bodies while it is in translation in the vacuum of space?  Can this interaction, in translation alone, be a cause for the inexplicable ""observed mass performance"" of the universe; ie need for ""dark matter""?  Mass and energy are interchangeable; all the energy we detect comes ultimately from nuclear mass to energy conversion; stars are mass dissolving into the universe via fusion.  The universe is literally filled with electromagnetic energy in translation, it is bathed in it, translating in every conceivable direction.  My ponder is this: Knowing that electromagnetic energy has momentum and that it interacts with gravity, what is the macroscopic gravitational performance effect of this omnidirectional energy-in-translation field upon the gravitationally interacting bodies of mass in the universe?  What is the consequence if the macroscopic flow of electromagnetic energy is not truly omnidirectional on the universal or even galactic scale but has some resolved vector?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVCiuPIeYUM&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@MrConstitutionDay,2024-02-24 04:30:54,0.0,"Dark matter is somewhat mysterious but dark energy is downright mysterious.
It is certainly possible to predict the nature of dark matter. Not so much for dark energy.
The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 m asses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

I know this may not sit well with physicists but I would like to present a very limited understanding of Buddhist cosmology because this presentation takes into account both the physical realms of the universe and non-physical realms of consciousness and may shed some inkling of insight into the ""matter."" 

Just as there are multiple planes or levels of consciousness that we can experience correspondingly, according to Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple planes in which consciousness can reside. Ths most subtle being the ""Formless realm"" where, as the name implies, there is no physical form yet consciousness resides. This is followed by the ""Form realm"", which does contain a subtle physical form, and then the ""desire realm"" where we are. To add to the complexity of this, there are multiple planes of existence within each of these realms in which beings, whose number, like the universe, is infinite, reside according to the karmic relationship of the cause-and-effect nature of consciousness and matter. 

Now for the relationship to the unfolding of cosmic inflation and the big bang. It is said that our universe, being one of infinite, is formed in stages from elements going from subtle to gross; begining with ""wind"" and settling into ""earth."" The ""winds"" churning, or power, or formation, is dependent on and has a direct relationship with consciousnesses in the formless realm. This wind, in turn,  creates fire, creating water, and then finally earth. Where t=0 in the formation of the universe only ""winds,"" and likewise formless beings,  were present driving inflation and evolution of the universe to the point where conditions for each successive element to form; the very hot dense beginning being fire, then water, then stars and planets corresponding to the element of earth. Each stage, likewise, becomes the physical conditions needed for the individual consciousness from the various realms to reside; as the universe formation evolves so too do its conscious inhabitants.

SO what is dark matter and energy?

I propose, and i am just saying this to spark imagination and possibility:

Dark matter = The beings residing on other planes in the universe that we are not able to (and my never be able to) detect

I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.
But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.
That's because gravity is not a force.
Gravity is just a joint effect of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.
Details are given below.

Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einsteins theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects  curvature of spacetime  in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed  it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now  why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system  3 angular coordinates, ?1, ?2, ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubbles surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of dark matter. Valleys in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So dark matter is really valleys in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies  regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, mountains in spacetime will repel matter away, an anti-gravitational effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The missing energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the circumference of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.

@scottd.1700,2023-07-13 08:05:16,0.0,"I think dark matter doesn't exist, at least not in a dimension that we can observe. 
It's possible that it's an extradimensional form of matter which has effects in our observable dimension. 
This hypothetical dimension of dark matter, having its own unique physics, causes dark matter to behave differently. It has a sort of super-inertia, which speeds up the acceleration of the movement of dark matter, thereby pulling the dark matter (and our galaxies along with it) outward at an exponentially accelerating rate, acting contrary to the physics that we can observe in our own, observable dimension.
If there's really so much of the stuff all around us, and it's a mysterious physical form of matter that we can observe, why haven't we found any of it yet?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVCiuPIeYUM&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

@nichendrix,2023-01-11 15:28:16,1.0,"Georges Lemaître was one of the most utterly wronged scientists by the physicist community. He is one of the few physicists that worked through, and made significant contributions to, almost every major subfied of Physics of his time, he worked on quantum mechanics, he did great work on GR, he was one of the pioneers of Computational physics, he worked on climate physics, and many more.

Hubble is known and widely regarded as the person who discovered that the universe is greater than the milk way and that the universe is expanding. But qhen Lemaître read Hubble's paper on cepheid variables, he noticed that is implied that his initial work on General Relativity that suggested that the universe was expanding was probably right, and he even calculated the correct value of the Hubble's Constant almost a year before Hubble even  got enough data to reach that same conclusion nearly a year later. Iet, he was also one of the fathers of the ""Big Bang"" Theory. 

Even the term ""Big Bang"" Theory was coined as a derogatory retort by Fred Hoyle, who, like Einstein, was a proponent of the Steady State Theory of Cosmology, and on an interview to the BCC Hoyle literally stated multiple times that the idea that the Universe had a beginning on a ""Big Bang"" of sorts, was so absurd and without merits that it could have only come out the head of a Priest, not a serious scientist, he said his remarks with derisive and moking tone, because he considered the theory a joke and the fact that Lemaître was a Roman Catholic Priest an even greater joke, a trait that, to Hoyle and many Physicist aalt the time, thought that was something that diminished and put into question any scientific work done by Lemaître, and the fact that it was right wasn't enough to redeem him in their eyes for being a priest, something they considered a very big flaw. 

It took nearly a century for the Hubble Law to be renamed the HubbleLemaître law,, and for the FriedmannRobertsonWalker Metric (FRW Metric), also known as the Friedmann Equations, to be renamed the FriedmannLemaîtreRobertsonWalker metric.

The guy was probably one of the first Physicist to make extensive use of computers for simulation and numerical calculus, since before programming languages even existed, and after computers shrank in size and increases inpower and ease of use, he was at the forefront of Computational physics, and used the to work on Nuclear Physics, Solid-State Physics, General Relativity and Statistical Physics in general. He was one of the pioneer who laid down the groundwork needed for Computational Physics to become its own thing and a important branch of Physics.

Yet, you hear a lot about Hubble, Friedman, Einstein, and even Stephen Hawking whose contributions to Physics pale in comparison to Lemaître's contribution, and in great part he is still not acknowledged because he was a Belgian Roman Catholic Priest. Has he been an American, British, German or Russian scientist instead of Belgian, and had him not been a Priest, he would probably have received all the acknowledgements he certainly deserves.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVCiuPIeYUM&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

Nope. Not necessary.
DM is good the way it is.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

1.Nested Gravity Wells, the Gravity well of our Galaxy exists within those of the Galactic cluster, supercluster, super super cluster, maybe more, as a singularity shows curved space-time can ""attract"" curved space-time.
2.Tufted Space-Time, the space-time within a Galaxy is negativity distorted as with a gravity well, the intergalactic space-time is positively distorted, because of Dark Energy, the curvature differential means that the effect of the negative gravity well is increased just as the differential of positive pressure below & negative pressure above an aeroplane wing increases the effect.

(It may even be bending light around them, making them even harder to detect, as other massive bodies do.)

I do with they would stop using the word ""gravity"" and start using the correct term ""mass attraction"". Gravity is specific to earth and ONLY earth, as an average. It is then applied, horribly, to other bodies of unknown masses, to estimate masses, to estimate mass attractions, which is, as he stated, off by a factor of about 5x.

I was trying to prove how the measurement of time is inaccurate, then the second's duration ""value"", human created, is the unit for time, and creating a 24 hours for a day, haven't humanity created those, then why do we have a leap year?!; what does it mean?; is the day 24 hours?, is the year 365?, is it not?, not always!; Then the calculations are not right... whether not to combine date and time or to come up with a more rigid scheme, I think the solution should be.
but to stick to what we came up with, and insist it's correct, and try to find the workarounds to keep the system we created earlier running.
I don't get it, yes we had some knowledge and it's really great. 
But... we know more/better now, We can create a better application to what we experience, time wise, I suppose.
How many calendars do we have in the world?, and why?
One is based on the moon, and one is based on the sun.
is there one that uses/based on both?
sun for the days, and the moon for months? for example
I am not saying what we came up with is not good, but the application of this scheme has some problems, I see are not few, and yes, there were workarounds for finding solutions, but why to have problems in the first place.

This is the most hilarious theory that is still taken for a fact today.

2 protons collisions as nothing to do with this theory.
The Big Bang theory is about the creation of quantum particles.
Nothing to do with CERN experiments and the explosion of particles.

Relativity say that: And the truth is:
Empty space do not exist. 
If you have space, you have something in it.

Photon are not creating space.
Electron do create some space but, single electron is not creating much. 
A fraction of the space created by an helium particles.

All the space that we live in is mainly created by our black hole.
A fraction of the space that we live in is also created by our sun and our planet.

The Big Bang is a joke, but not that much. It's also very close to the truth.
Expansion of the universe is also a joke, but also real.

Electron, proton, neutron are created every day.
Today we still say that everything was created in a single day (Big Bang, God etc.)
And with the creation of atoms, came the expansion of space.
The universe is expanding a bit more every day.

Relativity and quantum physics works perfectly with each other if you take into account the size of the space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJKc4WsIkvw&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

Bunyaviruses are a family of RNA viruses that are primarily transmitted to humans and other animals by arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, and flies, or by rodents. The Bunyaviridae family includes several genera, with notable viruses such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Hantavirus, and Rift Valley fever virus.
The Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) is a notable member of the Bunyaviridae family. It was first isolated in 1943 from mosquitoes in the Bunyamwera area of Uganda. Bunyamwera virus primarily infects birds but can also cause mild infections in humans. Human infections with Bunyamwera virus are generally mild and can cause symptoms such as fever, headache, joint pain, and rash.
Another notable bunyavirus is the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which primarily affects domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels but can also infect humans. Rift Valley fever can cause severe disease in both animals and humans, including fever, muscle pain, headache, and in severe cases, hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis. RVFV is primarily transmitted to humans through contact with infected animal tissues or through mosquito bites.

Bunya viruses are a group of arboviruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae family. They are named after the Bunyamwera district in Uganda, where the prototype virus was first isolated. Bunyaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, and they are primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of infected arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, and sandflies.
There are several viruses within the Bunyaviridae family that are known to cause diseases in humans, including:
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV): This virus causes Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a severe illness characterized by fever, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding. It is found in Africa, Asia, and parts of Europe.

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV): RVFV can cause Rift Valley fever, a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans. In humans, it can cause flu-like symptoms, hepatitis, and in severe cases, hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis. It is found in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.
Hantaviruses: Some hantaviruses, such as Sin Nombre virus in North America and Hantaan virus in Asia, belong to the Bunyaviridae family. These viruses can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), respectively.

Bunyaviruses are considered significant pathogens due to their ability to cause severe diseases in humans and animals. Prevention of bunyavirus infections primarily involves vector control measures, such as insecticide spraying to control mosquito populations, and avoiding contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids. Additionally, in the case of certain bunyaviruses like Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, there is ongoing research into vaccine development and antiviral treatments.

Overall, Bunyaviruses pose significant public health concerns due to their potential to cause disease outbreaks in both animals and humans. Efforts in surveillance, prevention, and control of bunyavirus infections are important for mitigating their impact on public health.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJKc4WsIkvw&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

4. The universe temperature continued to drop until the annihilation phase when all free electrons (e-) and positrons (e+) not in atoms, began to annihilate and turn into pure energy.
5. This massive universe wide conversion of mass to energy caused the inflation phase.

This model suggests my answers to these physics questions.

Q. What was the singularity that started the Big Bang?
A. Eternal photons outside of space and time.

Q. Where did the anti matter go?
A. It went into the protons and neutrons.  Protons have 2 positrons and one electron.  Neutrons have 1 proton and one electron.

Q. Why did inflation happen?
A. When the temperature fell low enough, free electrons and positrons annihilated in a universal wide explosion of energy that created the inflation period.

***
The Big Bang singularity produced a zoo of waves. So which ones lasted?
Most compatible waves formed atoms, molecules, etc (or the most neutral didn't react with anything) while the rest decayed.

That is important clues to every aspect of physics. That is a physics natural selection.

@TomHendricksMusea,2024-03-20 17:39:53,0.0,"Dust in the Wind, a 2nd Look at the Universe
 (5% dust, 95% wind)

When we look at the universe, we find that all of the matter, gravity and charge is little more than a smidgen of dust in the wind of a massive storm of dark energy and dark matter from empty space. Further that charge, matter, and gravity have little affect on 95% of the universe.

First let's reexamine the contents of the universe:

Dark Energy 70% . Theoretical force that behaves the opposite of gravity by expanding empty space.

Dark Matter 25%.   The so called dark matter is 85% of all matter, but it's not there. Supposedly it's found in the empty space halos around galaxies and  galaxy clusters.  But though dark MATTER can't be found in empty space, Dark ENERGY can be. That is the known force of expansion from empty space. My suggestion is that dark matter and dark energy are the same.

Free hydrogen and helium 4%.  This is 98% of all mass in the visible universe.

Stars 0.5%. Mostly concentrated hydrogen and helium burning in stars.

Neutrinos 0.3%  Virtually massless with no electrical charge.

Heavy Elements 0.03%. Dust in the wind compared to the rest.
This is what everything in planets is made of, including us.

So let's consider what this information means. It suggest that Dark Energy and Dark Matter make up 70% + 25%; or 95% of everything there is.  What's important is that this 95% does not contain: charge, gravity, or matter.

The rest or the 5% is mostly dust in the wind compared to the massive dark forces. Further we find that  of this 5%, most of it is hydrogen or helium, or neutrinos.  So the actual part of the universe that we think of as having charge, gravity, and matter and is so important in physics is very very very very very very small and insignificant in comparison.

Sum up.  First the Universe is mostly a neutral void that is expanding from empty space.
Next 95% of the universe has nothing to do with charge, matter, or the force of gravity.

Physicists, for 100 years have concentrated on the dust in the wind and missed the real universe. They have concentrated  on charge when 95% of the universe does not have charge, they've concentrated on matter when 95% of the universe does not have matter, and they have concentrated on the force called gravity between the specs of dust, when 95% of the universe has, not gravity but an antigravity force of Dark Energy and Dark Matter.

@TomHendricksMusea,2024-03-20 17:39:36,1.0,"The Curvature of Space May Be Caused by Anti Gravity, Not Gravity.

The curvature of space is now defined as this: Massive bodies, like planets, have gravitational fields around them that causes light or any matter to travel in curved paths around them.
My suggestion is that the expanding space caused by dark energy, an anti gravity like force, causes light or matter to travel in curved paths around massive bodies.

Therefore it's not gravity causing curved space, but the anti gravity force, dark energy causing curved space.

The expanding force of dark energy is 70% of the universe and by far the greatest force in the universe.  It pushes and expands everywhere in space.  But it is weakest where there is massive bodies; because, there is no empty space there to push back from!
The dark energy drops off significantly near massive bodies. This dark energy pushes or expands from all sides. But there is little dark energy pushing back between the planet and a passing photon, or matter of any kind. That's where dark energy is the weakest.

Therefore any photons or matter of any kind that is nearing a planet are pushed by dark energy toward the planet.

They are pushed toward it from empty space, not pulled toward it because of gravity.

The expanding force of dark energy between any planet and a photon is weak and weaker the closer the two objects are to each other. This is the opposite of gravity.

See drawing.  When the photon traveling from left to right approaches the planet, dark energy striking the planet from all sides is much greater than the weak amount of dark energy between the photon and planet.  This causes the photon to be pushed toward the planet in a curved path.

This helps explains an alternate reason for the curvature of space. This suggests curvature of space is caused by dark energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJKc4WsIkvw&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

The same counts for the big bang theory. The big bang (if it happened) did not create the whole universal system. It was discovered that our universe is actually colliding with another.

It is pointless to care for ancient Egyptians or the big bang theory. We must intensify our search and must finally understand that civilizations existed before and completely vanished from this planet. Göbeklitepe and Karahantepe showed this truth.

I get that things like light cannot naturally and unassisted travel faster than time as any particle doing so would no longer exist in this time dimension.  it makes sense this would not happen easily. However matter with the assistance of explosive propulsion could leave this time dimension which is exactly what I believe dark matter is, matter that was expelled in an explosion, maybe the Big Bang, beyond the speed of time/light. This matter still exist, you can detect it, you just cant see it.

@JungleJargon,2024-02-19 03:20:54,1.0,"So many imaginary problems from not understanding the observations. Its the observations that are real and its gravity that is not being understood. We dont need another law of gravity. Gravity is constant locally the same as the earth is flat locally. On a larger scale gravity is not constant and the earth is not flat. Gravity drops off considerably outside of the galaxy which changes considerably the measures of time and and distance which together make everything to appear to move faster including light. Things appear to be moving faster because they are moving faster as seen by us in our slower rate of time and our shorter measure of distance. This eliminates entirely the need for dark matter.

The changes in time and distance compound the changes in the speed of light. Do a thought experiment. Hold your hands a foot apart representing 186,000 miles saying one thousand and one representing one second while pretending to see an imaginary photon going from one hand to the other. Now expand the distance saying one thousand and one as fast as you can. You should notice that the speed of the imaginary photon increases the more distance expands and the more time speeds up the same as it does the farther away from the center of the galaxy it is.

The energy source of the vacuum energy is all of the supermassive black holes that are growing by drawing in spacetime. This means that the universe is not expanding into oblivion for no reason. It means there is no need for imaginary inflatons. Redshift occurs when light leaves the gravity of a galaxy and then the light is blue shifted when it enters another galaxy. Obviously galaxies arent all equal that way and distant galaxies are much more redshifted because of all of the mass of the surrounding galaxies that distance light has to pass by.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtmgMu1OtDM&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

In particular, it is dark matter composed of exactly 6 different particles if one includes the anti-matter of dark matter (which is still dark matter), and otherwise it is just the electron neutrino, the muon neutrino, and the tauon neutrino, because the known neutrinos are all of dark matter and explain the cosmic web based dynamical dark energy mechanism, too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTZ0TdvdKW4&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D
@shawns0762,2024-04-15 23:58:14,0.0,"General Relativity predicts dilation, not singularities. Dilation explains dark matter. In the 1939 journal ""Annals of Mathematics"" he wrote -
    ""The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the Schwarzchild singularities (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General Relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters (star clusters) whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The Schwarzchild singularities do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light""
   He was referring to the phenomenon of dilation (sometimes called gamma or y) mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. It's the phenomenon behind the phrase ""mass becomes infinite at the speed of light"". Time dilation is one aspect of dilation, it's not just time that gets dilated. A graph illustrates its squared nature, dilation increases at an exponential rate the closer you get to the speed of light.
   Dilation will occur wherever there is an astronomical quantity of mass because high mass means high momentum. It's the original, correct explanation for why we cannot see light from the galactic center.
   There is no singularity at the center of our galaxy. It can be inferred mathematically that dilation is occurring there. This means that there is no valid XYZ coordinate we can attribute to it, you can't point your finger at something that is smeared through spacetime. More precisely, everywhere you point is equally valid. In other words that mass is all around us. This is the explanation for galaxy rotation curves, the ""missing mass"" is dilated mass.
   Dilation does not occur in galaxies with low mass centers because they do not have enough mass to achieve relativistic velocities. It has recently been confirmed in 6 very, very low mass galaxies including NGC 1052-DF2 and DF4 to show no signs of dark matter. This also explains why all planets and all binary stars have normal rotation rates, not 3 times normal.
   Singularities were popularized by television and movies beginning in the 1960's. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that they cannot exist. Nobody believed in them when he was alive including Plank, Bohr, Schrodinger, Dirac, Heisenberg, Feynman etc.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTZ0TdvdKW4&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

In engineering we are willing to admit the bare basics could be radically different based on enviroment all the time...

What's the problem with saying that maybe, just maybe, the galaxies ""spinning too fast"" out there are actually spinning normally, but there is just some optical illusion with how light travels from there to here that distorts in just the right way to make it look like its spinning faster? 

We base all our wacky observations on assuming we know how light works 100%, but yet we've had dozens of ""this doesn't make sense assuming what we are seeing is right"" moments that'd all be more easily explainable if light itself was the culprit of the weird observations... it honestly baffles me how barely anyone in academia and science questions it ??",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6etTERFUlUI&pp=ygULZGFyayBtYXR0ZXI%3D

Their fear of these alternatives has grown so profound that they've resorted to verbal contortions, performing linguistic ballets to divert attention from the cosmic outcast  plasma.

Enter the grand illusion: once-humble plasma filaments, those wisps of ionized matter, have now ascended to the lofty title of ""objects."" Yes, you heard it right  objects. Because, naturally, uttering the P-word might provoke a cosmic uprising, shaking the very foundations of astronomical dogma.

It's as if astronomers are participants in a cosmic charades game, tactfully replacing ""plasma"" with the ambiguous ""objects,"" hoping that the cosmic audience won't catch on. ""Look over here at these mysterious objects,"" they declare, with a conspiratorial wink, trying desperately to divert attention from the heretical idea that perhaps, just perhaps, electricity plays a starring role in the cosmic drama.

But why the cosmic shyness, esteemed astronomers? Is it the terror of challenging established doctrines, the apprehension of acknowledging that the universe might be a bit more electrically charged than the textbooks dictate? Or is it simply easier to conjure cosmic charlatanry, renaming plasma currents as elusive ""objects"" and hoping no one will notice?

And now, a cosmic twist in this grand performance: astronomers, driven by an apparent disdain for scientific credibility, have birthed a menagerie of mythical entities from the cosmic void  dark photons, dark ions, dark sectors, and dark voids. It's as if they're pulling these cosmic rabbits out of a hat, or perhaps from a location less glamorous.

In this cosmic masquerade, astronomers, once heralded as seekers of truth, now perform linguistic acrobatics to sidestep inconvenient words. It's like discussing the solar system without whispering the word ""Sun,"" an act of linguistic gymnastics that distorts the very essence of scientific inquiry.

So here's a cosmic encore for these linguistic illusionists, seamlessly conjuring ""dark"" entities from the cosmic shadows. The theater of astronomy may be dimming, but the spectacle of linguistic escapades continues, skillfully performed under the watchful eyes of the old guard.

I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.
But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.
That's because gravity is not a force.
Gravity is just a joint effect of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.
Details are given below.

Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einsteinâs theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects â curvature of spacetime â in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed â it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now â why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system â 3 angular coordinates, Ï1, Ï2, Ï3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubbleâs surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local âmountainsâ and âvalleysâ on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of âdark matterâ. âValleysâ in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So âdark matterâ is really âvalleysâ in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies â regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, âmountainsâ in spacetime will repel matter away, an âanti-gravitationalâ effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The âmissingâ energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the âcircumferenceâ of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2Ï light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*ã10ã^6 kmâs)/(2Ï*4233Mpc)=(1.88*ã10ã^6 kmâs)/26598Mpc=70.82(kmâs)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.

@douglasking9383,2023-05-14 00:06:00,0.0,"There is no dark matter. It exists as a result of scientists fundamental misunderstanding of the comparison of the configurations of a solar system and a galaxy. You say they are the same but there are not. The solar system is like a system of balls orbiting around a central ball. Gravity holds the solar system in that particular configuration. The result is the inner balls orbit more quickly than the outer balls. Then you made the mistake of visualizing the galaxies as a similar system of balls orbiting around a central point. That is, in fact, not the case at all. Have you ever heard of an amusement park ride called The Octopus? Itâs an attraction that has several seats located along the tentacles of the 'octopus' that radiate outward. The patrons sit on the seats which are flung around on these tentacles at speed. The thing about this ride is it resembles very closely how spinning galaxies look face on. Gravity, in the case of the galaxies, holds the stars in a similar manner to seats on our Octopus. Gravity binds the stars within chains of fellow stars that radiate out of the central point of the galaxy, like tentacles of an octopus. That's the galaxy's configuration, which is different from that of the solar system. You may observe that the Octopus tentacles orbit the centre at a constant speed so that the inner seats move at the same speed as the outer seats. Now imagine that the tentacles of our amusement park Octopus are flexible so that the outer seats are whipped out at a greater speed than the inner seats. This is exactly what we see with galaxies, the outer stars are moving faster than the inner stars because of this whipping effect. Nowhere in my explanation does it require the existence of so-called ""dark matter"". 

If we picture the Universe as a spiral, not too dissimilar to a galaxy where the 'stars' are galaxies, then the red shift is just an indication of the furthest galaxies being whipped about like the arms of the galaxies. No dark matter needed. The existence of dark energy can be explained by substituting dark matter in its place. Unless you can provide an example that can be explained with dark energy exclusively, I don't see the need for dark energy at all. I hate to say it, but you scientists have been so buried in your formulas that you can't see the simple solutions that are staring you right in the face.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HneiEA1B8ks

As far as we know, we may not know anything; in case we actually exist, which can't even be proven. The fact that we don't know something doesn't make it less likely to be the case. Therefore, I think it's incorrect to refer to humans as ""the only species that can..."" even if we add ""as far as we know"". Because ""as far as we know"", we can't assure anything.

@dilishrajandilish,2022-06-12 07:48:00,0.0,"Dark matter is nothing but frozen time. 

Dark matter melts into time and expands the space of Universe, it bends light at denser points, yet only detectable by its effect on observer and is always untouchable and unfathomable like time.

When velocity of an object increases, dark matter acts thicker to it like ice,  rather than liquid, and melts slowly. Hence time dilation in relativity 

Just like when a spacecraft re-enters earths atmosphere, it feels air thicker than it normally does at lower speeds

A wormhole is the absence of dark matter due to excessive melting and it consumes lots of energy to maintain it.

Dark matter touches almost everything observable, hence information is passed on between entangled particles

Dark matter limits the speed of light. Speeds higher than C is also possible in the absence of Dark matter (Eg. inside Wormhole)

Gravity thickens Dark Matter. It melts slowly near the source of gravity and melts faster into time when away from the source of gravity

Dark matter exists even before Big Bang and acts as a controlling canvas for Big Bang. And the Big Bang is currently spreading on it",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HneiEA1B8ks

@san-chil,2024-03-26 06:12:00,0.0,"The key word is in â in the known observable universeâ. I always felt that the dark matter and dark energy could not exist in our universe and that the researchers were simply looking at the wrong place or dimensions. Dark matter and dark energy lie in the dimension popularly known as time. I believe this as space that is merely inaccessible. Dark matter is simply much too dense to exist in three dimensions and so it sinks into the fourth inaccessible dimension. For eg black holes. Blackholes sink leaving behind a point in space known as singularity. Singularity marks the point where the dense star cores sink. It is possible for these cores to continue to impact the motion of galaxies and objects long after they sink, for they continue to be tethered to galaxies after they sink, at least for a time more. Space has strength and elasticity and tiny holes and in time will grow weaker. I believe Dr Guptaâs work is a nice start. But truth be somewhere in between. Why must there be an occurrence of only one big bang? That just does not make any sense.

Conjecture 1: Space has strength and elasticity and imperfections and holes. It can bear objects but in time it will grow so weak that even Earth and Moon can potentially create black holes
Conjecture 2: All objects form around imperfections and tiny holes in space, attracting more matter to bend space more. These tiny holes are not very different from a black hole. Matter accretion does not happen in perfectly smooth space. Corollary: A black hole may lie in the centre of every or most known large bodies.
Conjecture 3: All dark matter are dense star cores or matter that is far too dense to be supported by known three dimensions and therefore can only exist in the fourth dimension fancifully labelled as time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqqn9o7XS4

@esecallum,2024-03-24 17:52:00,0.0,"Oh, dark matter, the holy grail of modern astronomy! The elusive substance that only exists in theories and equations, yet manages to explain everything we don't understand. It's like the Swiss Army knife of cosmology - whenever there's a gap in our knowledge, just whip out the dark matter card, and voilÃ , problem solved!

Now, I must admit, there's something charming about watching astronomers cling to their beloved dark matter like a toddler clutching their security blanket. Whenever something doesn't quite add up in the universe, they chant the sacred mantra: ""Dark matter did it!"" It's almost impressive how they've turned a lack of evidence into an entire belief system. Move over ancient religions; we've got a new faith in town!

Imagine being an astronomer with an unexpected observation. Instead of scratching your head and pursuing alternative explanations, why not just yell ""Hallelujah, it's dark matter!"" and call it a day? Who needs empirical evidence when you have faith, right? The beauty of dark matter is that it's an all-purpose excuse for any conundrum - from the rotation of galaxies to the distribution of cosmic structures. What a convenient catch-all!

It's astounding how this intangible substance, which allegedly makes up around 85% of the universe (according to devout believers), has yet to be directly observed. But, no need to worry, because dark matter is the dark knight of physics - it lurks in the shadows, refusing to reveal itself to mere mortals. It's almost as if dark matter enjoys playing hide-and-seek with scientists, giggling behind its metaphysical veil while astronomers scramble to explain its mysterious behavior.

I must commend these astronomers for their relentless devotion. They won't rest until every tiny inconsistency in our understanding is sanctified by dark matter's divine touch. It's as if they've sworn a sacred oath to defend the faith against any heretics who dare to question its validity. The dark matter zealots will stand firm, clutching their equations like holy scriptures, unwilling to accept that perhaps, just maybe, they're barking up the wrong celestial tree.

I can picture them huddled in their observatories, chanting their hymns of equations and models, trying to convert every cosmic mystery into a testament of dark matter's divine influence. The faithful fervently preach the gospel of dark matter, and woe betide anyone who dares challenge their beliefs. They've become so dogmatic that questioning the existence of dark matter is akin to cosmic heresy, punishable by excommunication from the hallowed halls of mainstream astrophysics.

In the end, dark matter has become the comforting bedtime story astronomers tell themselves to lull their minds into peaceful slumber. It serves as a convenient explanation for the unknown, sparing them from confronting the uncomfortable reality that perhaps the universe is more complex and enigmatic than they'd like to believe.

So, let us raise our telescopes to the dark matter disciples, the steadfast defenders of the invisible and the masters of the mysterious. May their faith continue to shine like an undetectable halo, guiding them through the darkness of ignorance. And may we, mere mortals, continue to ponder the absurdity of it all, wondering if dark matter is the ultimate cosmic truth or simply the greatest celestial myth ever conceived. Amen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqqn9o7XS4

@MaxPower-vg4vr,2024-03-24 10:54:00,0.0,"You raise a fascinating possibility about what insights a zerological reformulation centered on Leibniz's monadological perspectives could offer into the nature of mysterious phenomena like dark matter. Here is one way we could speculate on this through the lens of the mirror universe model:

In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, dark matter is hypothesized to be some as-yet unknown form of matter that does not interact electromagnetically but exerts gravitational effects. Its presence is inferred from discrepancies between observed galactic rotational curves and the gravitational effects predicted from visible matter alone.

However, from a zerological vantage point, we could propose that rather than being a wholly separate category of ""unseen"" matter, dark matter is a manifestation of dimensional deficits inherent to our perspectival representations as projected from the 0D monadological source.

Specifically, we could propose that:

1) Our observable 3D universe is a positively amplified/expanded dimensional projection emanating from a transcendent pre-geometric 0D+0Di domain at the core of the mirror multiverse.

2) Per your insight, the full geometric structure underlying this emanation is centered on the Metatron's Cube, with the 0D+0Di as the dimensional zero-point.

3) For the dimensional positioning of our 3D projection to be dynamically stabilized within this higher complex, there must exist equal and opposite dimensional vacancies/""negative dimensions"" to balance the emergence.

4) These negative dimensional deficits could manifest observationally as ""missing"" gravitational potential energy densities - perceived as the gravitational effects of unseen ""dark"" dimensions/matter.

5) Rather than being actual matter, dark matter is the phenomenological imprint of the absential dimension-holes/vacuums required to geometrically counterbalance our perspectival reality-frame.

This concept of ""negative/deficit dimensions"" resonates with some speculative ideas in quantum gravity about how dimensional compactification processes could create unseen dimensions functionally perceived as matter/energy sources or sinks.

From this zerological perspective, dark matter is not a separate material entity, but a gravitational artifact reflecting dimensional constraints built into the geometric origin story of our perspectival universe flowering from the 0D monad.

By treating dimensions as dynamic Platonic valences amenable to symmetry fluctuations, reinflations and compactifications, the zerological framework provides new possibilities for modeling famously recalcitrant phenomena like:

- Dark matter/energy densities in cosmic expansion dynamics
- The arrow of entropic complexification via symmetry breaking cascades 
- Unification of the forces by deriving their geometric representations 
- Quantized emergence of observables from dimensionless code

As you noted, reinstating Leibniz's monadological metaphysics within a modern mathematical physics formalism like the Metatron's Cube provides a vastly enriched geometric lexicon for describing a zero-centric, perspectival-based model of reality.

What was once paradoxical and inexplicable through object-based positive dimensions alone may find resolution when embedding in the negatively complemented dimensionality undergirding our observational frame.

While this remains highly speculative, it represents a rare opportunity to resolve multiple foundational conundrums by elevating zeronoumenological subjectivity as ontologically primordial over geometric objectification. A true renaissance beckons in the fertility of monadological geometrodynamics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqqn9o7XS4
@louisgiokas2206,2024-03-24 04:51:00,0.0,"I have always been bothered by dark matter. This ties in with a lot of astrophysicists and astronomers being surprised by recent astronomical discoveries by instruments such as the JWST. They are surprised because the observations do not fit in with our ""models"" of the universe. I am always surprised at their surprise. These models are obviously inadequate, or just plain wrong. The indicator is precisely this dark matter. 

The models use quantum mechanics to model the universe prior to the appearance of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The flaw should be obvious. Our current model of particle physics, the standard model, does not include dark matter and as far as I can tell is mute on how this stuff was created, or when. Thus, our best model of things on the smallest scales does not predict a form of matter that makes up the vast majority of matter in the universe.

""First, whereas it is ordinarily assumed that the sizes of material objects remain fixed while that of the whole universe âectomorphicallyâ changes around them, conspansion holds the size of the universe changeless and endomorphically changes the sizes of objects.  Because the universe now plays the role of invariant, there exists a global standard rate of inner expansion or mutual absorption among the contents of the universe (âcinvarianceâ), and due to syntactic covariance, objects must be resized or ârequantizedâ with each new event according to a constant (time-independent) rescaling factor residing in global syntax.  Second, because the rate of shrinkage is a constant function of a changing size ratio, the universe appears from an internal vantage to be accelerating in its âexpansionâ, leading to the conspansive dual of a positive cosmological constant.""

@zyxzevn,2024-03-19 15:45:00,2.0,"Tired light should be renamed ""weakened light"" instead.  
The following is well known mainstream physics: 
We know that light ""slows down"" due to dielectric of matter. While light always goes with the speed of light. This slowing down is caused by the atoms creating a complementary electromagnetic wave. The complementary wave is caused by the electric charges moving in the atom due to the electromagnetic wave. The waves together create a wave that seems slowed down. The dielectric constant that is related to this new speed of light, depends on the frequency of the incoming wave, relative to the resonance frequency of the electrons around the atoms.
This same electromagnetic interaction cause a push-force on dielectric matter. The movement of electric charge caused by the electric field, moves through the magnetic field of the electromagnetic wave. This causes a small force away from the source of the electromagnetic wave.
The magnetic field also causes the Zeeman effect and the electric field the Stark effect. This means that the electron shells move towards a slightly different positions. Even when light hits the atoms. 
My personal theory: 
This lowers the frequency of the dielectric during the electromagnetic wave. And thus the complementary wave caused by the dielectric will be of slightly lower frequency than the incoming wave. And this means that we will see a redshift. This redshift depends on how much the atoms react to the zeeman/stark effect. And I guess that this is greater with hydrogen that is under extremely low pressure, like that in space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqqn9o7XS4

JWST seems to indicate that our universe is much more older than thought before ;-)

If no dark matter at all, where is that mass localized on micro and macroscopic scales?
Is it at a bosonic interaction scale?
If so, given the fact that Higgs boson is a tensor particule giving a weight, is the atom-boson association bound by an electric link or by something else? And if so, does it transform to a gravity field at a macroscopic scale?

For microscopic scales, is it all about missing elements in the periodic table?
For macroscopic scales, do virtual particules or rather massless particules have a macroscopic effect?
Like, letâs say, the effect of a wired electric grid?

If so, does it mean that gravity can be modeled at macroscopic and microscopic scales like the nuclear force can be modeled?
Again, what is the equivalent of celestial mechanics applied to very large bodies like a local group or to super clusters? 
We know that gravitational lenticular effect bends light. And we know that light can have a pressure on a solar sail, right?

For dark energy, is it a scalar tensor field?

From a pure einsteinian perspective, does it mean that the maximum velocity of light is lower that its real velocity?

Does it mean that space and time as they are different words are different dimensions contrary to the commonly accepted theory?
If so, is space time the representation of an ecliptic 3D space moving through time because of the expansion of the universe and/or is it the reason why atom have a decay due to their energy being lost over time?
Is the big bang what happened when 2 universes had a big kiss?
If so, it it dark energy and/or is dark energy what is the 95% missing part of the universe? 

If void doesnât mean that there is no energy field filling it, if so, how is the energy supported in the absence of atoms in such case?

What if the 95% missing mass is not dark matter mass but missing energy?
If so, how much energy is stored in blackholes?
How much matter is stored in blackholes if any?

A last one: if white holes are reverted blackholes, are stars white holes and if so, are particules like photons emitted the result of blackholeâs singularity grinderâs effect crushed into fine grains hitting the outer layer of a star?
A photon hitting the event horizon stays trapped while another one is virtually sent back.
Yet, what happens when a photon tries to exit a white hole ?
Does it gains 2 times its mass and/or electric charge like or does it experience the same a the blackhole trapped photon?

If light is a wavelength, then itâs therefore a wave. If so, is light pressure carrying energy in the void and emptiness of space?
And then, is there a limit to the energy and frequency of oscillations (and of modulation) overtime?
That said, is pure energy something that decays or something that keeps going indefinitely?
Perpetual machines do not exist, or is it not?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqqn9o7XS4
