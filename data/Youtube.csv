"QAa2O_8wBUQ","What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?","@voiceofkanaan2572","Dark matter is basically what the Allah described in the Quran in verse (25:45). We constantly describe reality around us according to our own eyes, but this is flawed understanding because God was, is the only eternal entity there is and anything else including the darkness of space, and shadows are created  from nothing, which is what creating means. Meaning the shadows we see, the darkness that is in space were not originally there and ""not eternal"" to begin with. Therefore we cannot say the space and darkness is nothing and we cannot say it is being created ""by"" nothing rather ""from"" nothing.  This verse about the reality of shadows God exactly mentioned after talking about how people depend solely on their minds to be guided about the meaning of life to tell you that, just like the empirically untouchable shadows, your thought process is also invisible to you but it is still a non-eternal thing that was created and unless you follow the word of God which is revealed to humans by prophets completely as is and unchanged ""the pure word of the lord"", you cannot be guided.   Bottom line is, you cannot depend on a created thing to be guided to the uncreated ""God"" because you will constantly fall victim to the whims of the relativity of the human mind. (just like they though that the shadow is the absence of light when darkness is really a created thing that covers everything and expands and contracts in synchrony with light). Come to God and read the Quran, the only true book left unchanged from all the previous messages."

"QAa2O_8wBUQ","What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?","@dallas69","An idea derived from string theory suggests that dark matter is hiding in a (relatively) large extra dimension.   The theory makes testable predictions that physicists are investigating now.  Now  If you need 6 strings to be matter and there is only 5 strings those 5 strings never pop into our dimensions as matter.  Those 5 stings continuously try to be matter in our dimension but fail continuously.   The 5 strings may be considered virtual matter never to become matter in our dimension but actually produce a force in our dimension. Thus dark energy.  So  Dark Matter is failed strings attempting to come into existence in our dimensions  Dark Energy is failed strings creating forces in our dimensions attempting to come into existence in our dimensions.  Failed Strings are everywhere and continuous pop in and pop out of our dimension"

"QAa2O_8wBUQ","What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?","@virxest","It's actually easy to figure out what all these mysterious energies are that we can't see. We are in the same space of existence, but we live in the lowest layer of reality called ""physical reality"". The densest and lowest frequency energy. The higher ""layers"" are invisible to us because we are limited by nature/physical body. A higher frequency being/consciousness can see/communicate with lower forms, but not vice versa. Scientists should stop looking for answers because it is not meant for us to see or understand. If you want to experience and see these energies, you have to leave this body (we call it death), your frequency (we call it soul) becomes much higher and now you suddenly understand everything. The higher energy passes through the lower and the being that exists in the lower energy ""field"" does not understand anything...these are us. We came from these fields and now we are trying to ""rediscover"" them."
"QAa2O_8wBUQ","What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?","@MrConstitutionDay","The dark matter model is strange. It is strongly connected to the quarks of the standard model of particle physics.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be."

"QAa2O_8wBUQ","What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?","@Archin-dn4bp","Now astronomers cannot understand why galaxies rotate too quickly without falling apart.  They came up with dark matter, which creates additional gravity and allows galaxies to rotate so quickly.  But they can't find this dark matter.  What if there is no dark matter?  Maybe there another interaction of matter on large scales?  Weaker than gravity, but even longer-range. Let's say its strength decreases not as the square of the distance, but less.  Because of this, on a small scale, such as the solar system, its influence is imperceptible due to its insignificant micropower.  But on the scale of galaxies, over many tens of light years, this force is more powerful than gravity due to a more significant weakening of the gravitational force.  Following the example of strong and weak nuclear interaction: there can also be strong and weak gravitational interaction.  This could explain why galaxies rotate faster than gravity allows."

It is therefore neither a resulting nor an additional factor since a ""Big Bang"". The universe is an open and not a closed system - because the fact that we should exist under laboratory conditions is an unfounded scientific assumption that also seems completely unnatural. Physical, chemical and biological processes are sets of rules that build on each other - and are preceded by at least one even more fundamental one."

"fX_1pM64uUk","Where Did Dark Matter And Dark Energy Come From?","@mykrahmaan3408","There is a far more important (meaning: with enormous practical benefit for sustenance of evil free life on this earth)  and extremely easily accessible matter to investigate:  There certainly exists a particle physical mold inside the earth that enables composition of our bodies with exactly the same number and type of parts (2 eyes, 32 teeth, 6 main bone types ~ head, torso, 2 arms, 2 legs) being delivered through PLANTS as food, air and water to be assembled by other already delivered ones - several millions of times every single day.  There are no special experiments and/or observations needed to understand this fact, but ONLY the readiness to functionally link the 3 entities (PLANTS, ANIMALS and HUMANS) systematically to derive the mathematical model of this mold to precisely specify how particle interactions inside the earth develop PLANTS on its own surface, to then deliver and sustain beings here through them.  Once we get this model ready we can steer the process in such a way that all evil (disasters, predation, diseases ~ including all birth defects and violence ~ and death) can be PREVENTED by acting on their sources while they are still inside the earth, so that they never reach the surface to harm any being.  Why waste time, efforts and trillions in funds for education and research, when such a simple solution exists to all the problems human race faces, if we are only prepared to consider this possibility seriously?"

I know my guess is probably wrong, but it would answer the increase as the universe grows, not an educated guess as I am no scientist and not smart enough to be one just trying to say it in a way I understand."

"fX_1pM64uUk","Where Did Dark Matter And Dark Energy Come From?","@MrConstitutionDay","It looks like the dark matter subject is rather quiet. I think that the subject is now much more settled.  I'm looking forward to more scientific edudion on the subject. Maybe we can see it when the discovery of dark matter has been made.   The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

It's very special to be able to follow along on the history through the current interpretations of all of these incredible concepts. I'd heard of and read about many of these concepts already, but it's always been difficult to map these discoveries chronologically, and with respect to how each concept interacts with another to help build out the model. We've come a long way since Galileo and even Newton. The only dissatisfying thing about these episodes is the realization that too few of our youth and young adults are being taught these concepts in even their simplest forms. Our younger generations are downright ignorant of these concepts and of the immense bodies of work gone into mapping the history of our reality. They don't understand for even a moment that driving a car or using a cell phone invokes countless invisible and unnoticeable concepts that brilliant minds of the past were determined to solve. In solving them, they made it a possibility to actually harness these things to create technology that today we can't imagine being without. It's so bad nowadays that not only are they ignorant, but they're creating counter-theories and denying previous discoveries. They think of them as conspiracies and frauds. Flat-Earthers and moon landing deniers come to mind, but there are many more that are just too stupid to take seriously. Not enough young people are being taught about scientific discovery in the fields of physics and astronomy, and about how those scientific genres actually affect their lives. More than anything else, I pity these young people because they may never watch magic unfold into reality, and they may never gain that fulfilling obsession of wanting to know the truth."

"uBbxXNhZ78c","Neil deGrasse Tyson: What is Dark Matter? What is Dark Energy?","@MrConstitutionDay","The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be."

"uBbxXNhZ78c","Neil deGrasse Tyson: What is Dark Matter? What is Dark Energy?","@BrianCStratton","I would like to begin admitting I am an ignorant human but nonetheless very curiuos as well.  I know this may not sit well with physicists but I would like to present a very limited understanding of Buddhist cosmology because this presentation takes into account both the physical realms of the universe and non-physical realms of consciousness and may shed some inkling of insight into the ""matter.""   Just as there are multiple planes or levels of consciousness that we can experience correspondingly, according to Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple planes in which consciousness can reside. Ths most subtle being the ""Formless realm"" where, as the name implies, there is no physical form yet consciousness resides. This is followed by the ""Form realm"", which does contain a subtle physical form, and then the ""desire realm"" where we are. To add to the complexity of this, there are multiple planes of existence within each of these realms in which beings, whose number, like the universe, is infinite, reside according to the karmic relationship of the cause-and-effect nature of consciousness and matter.   Now for the relationship to the unfolding of cosmic inflation and the big bang. It is said that our universe, being one of infinite, is formed in stages from elements going from subtle to gross; begining with ""wind"" and settling into ""earth."" The ""winds"" churning, or power, or formation, is dependent on and has a direct relationship with consciousnesses in the formless realm. This wind, in turn,  creates fire, creating water, and then finally earth. Where t=0 in the formation of the universe only ""winds,"" and likewise formless beings,  were present driving inflation and evolution of the universe to the point where conditions for each successive element to form; the very hot dense beginning being fire, then water, then stars and planets corresponding to the element of earth. Each stage, likewise, becomes the physical conditions needed for the individual consciousness from the various realms to reside; as the universe formation evolves so too do its conscious inhabitants.  SO what is dark matter and energy?  I propose, and i am just saying this to spark imagination and possibility:  Dark matter = The beings residing on other planes in the universe that we are not able to (and my never be able to) detect   Dark energy = The forces and interrelationship of matter and consciousness of the various beings that reside within the universe"

Dark matter is a thing, or rarher a current phenomenon. We know its a thing as current physics does not account for large scale stability as seen in galaxies without additional gravity or a binding agent needed.   I am of the mind that gravity is governed by a particle, like every other force, or you all just misunderstand the mechanics of gravity.   You see it as a warping of space time, but those models dont work without dark matter. Gravity ia more like a spiders web than a whirlpool. Its force pulls on eveything around it, yet the pull is felt event billions of miles away, yet, other strings pull in different directions, at all.times with different levels of force.   The collective network of objects all pulling on each other is what dark matter is.   That, or its a graviton. If all fundamental forces are represented with a particle, than its only logical to conclude that gravity does as well. Assume its there, work backwards. How would it have to function if it existed and look there."

Just a disclaimer, I am not a trained astrophysicist. Sometimes, some scientists explain it in the way of ""exotic"" matter that cannot be detected via conventional or latest technology at hand but can be deduced by the way it interacts with its surroundings and affects them like gravitational lensing etc. After the failure of the CERN experiments to reproduce or detect the dark matter, scientists went back to saying its just matter that cannot be seen.  I remember up until late 1980s,  the astronomers around the world were baffled by the deviations in the calculated  orbits of Uranus and Neptune. This led the astronomers to believe that there was another massive planet beyond Uranus snd Neptune that was exerting its gravitional pull on these outer planets. When Voyager II visited Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989, the masses of the planets were calculated again from the data obtained from the spacecraft and their orbits were calculated again the voila, the discrepancies ir deviations in their orbits disappeared.   So from our Earth based observations, we erroneously calculated the wrong masses of these planets leading to discrepancies in their orbits, leading the astronomers to hypothesize about the existence of another giant planet, which was never there.   I think same is the case with dark matter. Either we do not know the actual mass of the galaxies or visible the visible matter, leading us to think that there is more matter that can be seen via our most sophisticated instruments. I think the anomalies that we attributed to dark matter, could be explained other alternative theories thst are waiti g to be discovered."

They measured the mass of the observable universe and find it lacking so dark matter or dark energy fills this void. But.. some of the stars we see in the sky are so far away that they've gone supernova a billion years ago. Aren't they not taking into account the fact that we are looking into the past and every star around us is just an older snapshot of what the planet looked like when the light started traveling to us. So our picture of what the universe looks like gets progressively less accurate the further we look. So why isn't this ""dark stuff"" just the galaxies and solar systems as they are now, which we won't see for billions of years? It sounds like they're trying to plug in extra stuff like say.. ""solar system a"" has an invisible ring of mass around it and that explains the extra mass we detect. But maybe ""solar system a"" had collided with solar system d 1 billion years ago and through that process has changed properties or the black hole somehow got dragged away by and merged into bigger one and now there is less entropy or something. I can't really conjecture accurately on what could have changed for each galaxy but surely there's too many variables for us to know what the current galaxy looks like now? We only know what it used to look like right? Am I completely off here?"

It is an energy field composed of quantum fluid, a substance which allows the clustering of matter interacts with each other, allowing the formation of gravitational tunnels, which maintains dimensional matter grouped and in balance. Dark matter can vary from ""quantum density"" depending on the necessary response to the volume of material bodies involved, which can cause curvature in the beams of photons that is, bend light, as happens in refraction created in the ""dimensional material"" when its layers are at different temperatures. The creation of the portals of transport are based on the mechanics of opening gaps in the dark matter, eliminating their natural influence and creating passages without ""time"" or ""gravitational influence"" by intergalactic space. This fluid shows only function when its influence is required by the presence of matter in any dimensional form and in any dimension of existence, because their gravitational influence is excited to the extent that is necessary to balance the forces and trends of dense matter. It has no friction because it contains no particles sized, only ""fluid compensation"" that is, it presents itself in its natural state as a multidimensional matter."

In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be."

To escape the dead end, they invent or design another imaginary particle in vain instead of trying to revise their way to approach to the problem.     I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.  But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.  That's because gravity is not a force.  Gravity is just a joint effect of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.  Details are given below.    Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy    Einstein‚Äôs theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass.   This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.  Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.  However, we also observe gravitational effects ‚Äì curvature of spacetime ‚Äì in areas without any detectable mass.  This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.  So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.    An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed ‚Äì it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.  In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.    So, the question is now ‚Äì why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?  The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.  Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.  Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system ‚Äì 3 angular coordinates, œÜ1, œÜ2, œÜ3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.  We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.  Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.  The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.    The expansion rate at one point on the bubble‚Äôs surface may differ slightly from another point near it.  The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.  The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local ‚Äúmountains‚Äù and ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù on the surface of the universe bubble.  The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù. ‚ÄúValleys‚Äù in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.  So ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù is really ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.  These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies ‚Äì regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.  Conversely, ‚Äúmountains‚Äù in spacetime will repel matter away, an ‚Äúanti-gravitational‚Äù effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.  Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.  These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.  This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.  It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.  The ‚Äúmissing‚Äù energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.  The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.    Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.  As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.  Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.  Therefore, the ‚Äúcircumference‚Äù of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2œÄ light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.  This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.    At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).    Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:     Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/(2œÄ*4233Mpc)=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/26598Mpc=70.82(km‚ÅÑs)/Mpc    The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.  There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  ‚Äì Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy"

It exists as a result of scientists fundamental misunderstanding of the comparison of the configurations of a solar system and a galaxy. You say they are the same but there are not. The solar system is like a system of balls orbiting around a central ball. Gravity holds the solar system in that particular configuration. The result is the inner balls orbit more quickly than the outer balls. Then you made the mistake of visualizing the galaxies as a similar system of balls orbiting around a central point. That is, in fact, not the case at all. Have you ever heard of an amusement park ride called The Octopus? It‚Äôs an attraction that has several seats located along the tentacles of the 'octopus' that radiate outward. The patrons sit on the seats which are flung around on these tentacles at speed. The thing about this ride is it resembles very closely how spinning galaxies look face on. Gravity, in the case of the galaxies, holds the stars in a similar manner to seats on our Octopus. Gravity binds the stars within chains of fellow stars that radiate out of the central point of the galaxy, like tentacles of an octopus. That's the galaxy's configuration, which is different from that of the solar system. You may observe that the Octopus tentacles orbit the centre at a constant speed so that the inner seats move at the same speed as the outer seats. Now imagine that the tentacles of our amusement park Octopus are flexible so that the outer seats are whipped out at a greater speed than the inner seats. This is exactly what we see with galaxies, the outer stars are moving faster than the inner stars because of this whipping effect. Nowhere in my explanation does it require the existence of so-called ""dark matter"".     If we picture the Universe as a spiral, not too dissimilar to a galaxy where the 'stars' are galaxies, then the red shift is just an indication of the furthest galaxies being whipped about like the arms of the galaxies. No dark matter needed. The existence of dark energy can be explained by substituting dark matter in its place. Unless you can provide an example that can be explained with dark energy exclusively, I don't see the need for dark energy at all. I hate to say it, but you scientists have been so buried in your formulas that you can't see the simple solutions that are staring you right in the face."

"zUhOL38346Y","Did JWST Discover Dark Matter Stars?","@MrConstitutionDay","Dark matter in small quantities starts the production of planets and stars. Entire stars made only of dark matter are rare. Nearly every star has a lot of dark matter at its center. Discovery of dark matter will be soon.  It depends on the speed of space exploration and development.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

Only time and action can tell you what is real. Maybe one of these days, if we manage to achieve absolute zero temp, we will have enough understanding to predict quantum fluctuations, predict the future, and have a solid understanding of how the universe functions from tip to butt, including gravity. Of course there very well may be universal barriers that prevent us from doing this. Ironically, this also helps with the Fermi paradox.

It was simple, elegant, stupendously accurate, and was easily shown to be consistent under a variety of experimental conditions.  At much larger scales, it ceased to predict the effects of gravity adequately.  A new theory of gravity was required.  Einstein formulated an improved theory of gravity.  It works for all practical applications of our time.  It is more complicated, but still elegant, even more stupendously accurate, and is easily shown to be consistent under a much wider variety of experimental conditions.  It also manages to account for the inconsistencies of the previous theory at those much larger scales.  But at even greater scales, unimaginable scales, it ceases to predict the effects of gravity adequately...  I wonder what might be needed.  Is there some historical precedent we might look to?  Oh, I know:  a conjured exotic particle whose characteristics are without precedent, and whose existence can neither be verified nor disproved with any conceivable experiment or observation.  Oh, and those unprecedented characteristics, they conveniently account for the inconsistencies observed with this newest gravitational theory.  Dark matter in the form of WIMPs, like string theory, is at its core, hand-wavy pseudoscience, no matter how many scientists, papers, educators, and books you throw at it.

More like a gas with density, pressure, momentum, energy. vorticity, magnetic moment, charge, concentrations of things.  All that is required is a simple 3D visualization like a point cloud.  Please!  a rubber sheet and bowling ball might have been good enough three decades ago, but we certainly can do much better than that now.  If it will help you, then think of the gravitational potential itself, and its associated gradient, the gravitational accelerations. The physical vacuum is not a bad way to remember.  Change the reflectivity, transparency for every voxel according to some reasonable visualization.    We don't any Internet wide standard for 3D videos.  We should. Then you could change your viewpoint while the 3D video to let you see things from different places, and at different time rates (change over a vast range of frame rates to see details invisible to humans).  If you integrate the gravitational energy density, that value can be calculated for every point in space.  Is it exact or verified?  Not yet. But it is one place to start.  Even simple things like electron densities, axion densities and their respective flows, vorticities and temperature can have complex and beautiful periodic and chaotic structures.  You are representing a complex beautiful field with a cheap visualization.   So this old method is a lot misleading.  At least use the gravitational potential and then color it some way humans can see.  We false color radio telescope pictures and a vast number fields and signals that humans cannot directly see.  There are excellent models for the global gravitational and magnetic fields of the earth at the surface and into space.  They are in spherical harmonic forms, and real time measurement.  It takes a bit of looking to find a decent calculator, then a 3D visualizer.  But not impossible.  Maybe your friendly geophysicist or astrophysicist friends can do it for you.   Most people are not familiar with the gravitational energy density.  I only happened on it back in the 1970's after I met Joe Weber.  He told me to look at his student, Robert Forward's, work.  It is g^2/(8 pi G) in SI units, where g is in (meters/second^2), and G is 6.6743E-11 (meters/second^2) per (kilogram/meter^2).  At the surface of the earth the gravitational energy density is the same as a magnetic field of about 380 Tesla, a laser of 1.7E19 Watts/m^2 or a black body at 2.95 million Kelvin (not sure if this to within a factor 2 based on different model assumptions).  My point is that space is not empty by any means.  Even if you do not fill it with gravitons and axions, the gravitational potential itself is extremely stable and well understood.  At least color that in 3D so people can see it. And you will see that the earth's gravitational potential is dwarfed by the sun.   The gravitational potential changes constantly because of changes in the atmosphere, oceans, and earth on the earth, and changes on the sun and moon and more distant sources of gravitational potential change.  So if you really want to get fancy show how that is changing constantly.  The time dilation equation used for GPS time corrections can be used to show how that changes with time. And it is well defined everywhere in space, so you could plot the rate of clocks, or the vacuum index of refraction, anywhere on earth or in space or on the sun or on the moon - as a function of time.  Many many experiments on earth and in space are now sensitive enough to measure these changes in the potential. And many more can measure the gradient of the gravitational potential, the gravitational acceleration.  Any 3D video would be fine.    Thank you for listening.  Please don't use that rubber sheet any more. Gravity is not a rubber sheet!!   I have to deal with the gravitational potential every day.  My own view is that it is filled with gravitons, axions, quarks, gluons and neutrinos in different concentrations. These vary in mass and number density, velocity and cross section.  It might be wrong, but that simple step greatly simplified things for me.  And gave me a more concrete thing to ""see"" with my human mind when I try to visualize the action of the gravitational potential field at atomic, subnuclear and global scales.  I guess I am more a chemist.  I like to count moles of gravitons, and not leave them invisible and transparent, even if my human eyes cannot see them.   Richard  Collins, The Internet Foundation"

Born from the primordial cauldron of cosmic inflation, it burgeons forth, a cosmic symphony orchestrated by the harmonious interplay of fundamental forces. Within its boundless expanse, galaxies dance in cosmic ballets, birthing stars that illuminate the cosmic canvas with their incandescent radiance.  Yet, amidst this celestial grandeur, lurk enigmatic entities known as black holes, gravitational behemoths that warp the fabric of spacetime itself, swallowing all that dare to venture too close, ensnared by their voracious gravitational embrace. These cosmic anomalies, born from the cataclysmic deaths of massive stars, serve as cosmic sentinels, guardians of the cosmic order, where the laws of physics are stretched to their limits and our understanding of the universe is put to the test.  Through the lens of modern cosmology and quantum mechanics, we endeavor to unravel the mysteries shrouding the universe's genesis, its evolution, and its ultimate fate. From the cosmic microwave background radiation that whispers the secrets of the universe's infancy to the elusive dark matter and dark energy that pervade the cosmic tapestry, each discovery unveils new layers of complexity, challenging our perceptions and beckoning us towards a deeper understanding of the cosmos that we call home."

So the idea that dark matter particles could clump into eachother seems highly unlikely. But there are many hypothetical theories out there so if we get to have the experience to evolve more as a civilization we will figure things out some day."

"DDMOHLZtYLM","What is dark matter? ‚Äì with Peter Fisher","@MrConstitutionDay","It's a ubiquitous question ""what is dark matter""? The author is concerned with the standard  model, and his credibility. So obvious solutions to this thorny question cannot be addressed.  The following answer should not be ignored.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

When you look at the pie chart, and see that the vast majority of ""stuff"", is apparently not discovered yet, you have got to understand the math is wrong.  Seriously, we have a theory called the BIG BANG, that was followed by something that could not happen... INFLATION... and then to explain all that can't be explained, you invent something and a form of math that somewhat helps explain things... you again have to know it's just all wrong. Remember, everyone thought that electrons protons and neutrons could not be divided... only got that 1/3 right.... and we thought gravity came from the graviton... well, you know how that's turned out. This is no periodic table with actual points in it that you can nicely fit in a form of energy and matter. The ripples in the formation of the universe are just ripples in the fabric of the universe that is all quantum in nature.  The apparent acceleration of the universe is not more than a ripple in space, and while I'm on it, won't mention time, as time does NOT exist... it is simply a mechanism created by man to make large scale calculations possible with our limited math ability. It's like a wave reaching the shores and getting bigger and apparently having more affect  on the surrounds... but it's just a ripple. If you think that space is expanding faster and faster, then it must reach a point at some stage in the future where it can no longer support the quantum nature of matter and at that point everything will instantly disappear... and well, I'm fairly sure that is not going to happen. There will never be a theory of everything, because there can be no theory that will work on the level of a Universe, and then down at the field level of the universe. Stop trying to create matter and energy that doesn't exist, that fits in to our current math, and understand, you'll need to get string theory down pat and understand the nature of the fields that make up space before we have any idea of how the universe is really working."

It is a principle about knowing to different bits of information about a system simultaneously.  It is a measurement problem.  The more you know about velocity, the less you know about location.  This has nothing to do with physical densities and is not a reason for differences in physical densities.  You aren't just confusing the measurement with what you are measuring, but confusing the interpretation of the measurement with what you are measuring.  You also infer a causation correlation fallacy in your statement.  This is as fallacious as when particle physicists make statement like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows for pairs of particles to come into existence and annihilate each other before they can be measured.  Uncertainty also implies that the universe needs observers for physics to happen............ Statements like timeframe 16:05, allow the insertion of mathematical models that do not represent reality to be inserted as if they are fact.

"DDMOHLZtYLM","What is dark matter? ‚Äì with Peter Fisher","@michaelkahn8744","The problem of modern physics is they're trying to explain everything with particle physics and the physics is being cornered more and more to the dead end. To escape the dead end, they invent or design another imaginary particle in vain instead of trying to revise their way to approach to the problem.     I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.  But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.  That's because gravity is not a force.  Gravity is just a joint effect of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.  Details are given below.    Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy    Einstein‚Äôs theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass.   This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.  Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.  However, we also observe gravitational effects ‚Äì curvature of spacetime ‚Äì in areas without any detectable mass.  This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.  So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.    An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed ‚Äì it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.  In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.    So, the question is now ‚Äì why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?  The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.  Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.  Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system ‚Äì 3 angular coordinates, œÜ1, œÜ2, œÜ3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.  We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.  Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.  The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.    The expansion rate at one point on the bubble‚Äôs surface may differ slightly from another point near it.  The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.  The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local ‚Äúmountains‚Äù and ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù on the surface of the universe bubble.  The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù. ‚ÄúValleys‚Äù in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.  So ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù is really ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.  These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies ‚Äì regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.  Conversely, ‚Äúmountains‚Äù in spacetime will repel matter away, an ‚Äúanti-gravitational‚Äù effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.  Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.  These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.  This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.  It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.  The ‚Äúmissing‚Äù energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.  The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.    Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.  As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.  Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.  Therefore, the ‚Äúcircumference‚Äù of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2œÄ light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.  This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.    At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).    Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:     Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/(2œÄ*4233Mpc)=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/26598Mpc=70.82(km‚ÅÑs)/Mpc    The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.  There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  ‚Äì Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy"

"DDMOHLZtYLM","What is dark matter? ‚Äì with Peter Fisher","@peter4210","TLDR: Dark matter is a theoretical magical matter that was invented over 100 years ago by some guy who applied newtons law while looking at a galaxy and realized that the outer most objects were not spinning around the galactic center as slow as orbital mechanics dictated. They did move at the right speed if the guy toke into account that the galaxy was heavier then he estimated the weight to be at. To him, fudging the numbers to get the right answer meant that the problem was that he was not seeing the missing matter instead of assuming the math to be wrong. Because maths in a era they had not gone to the moon yes was obviously not flawed, he theorized that there is somehow a dark, invisible form of matter.   Modern dark matter believers say that over 70% of the universe matter is dark matter, how every they are not able to detect or prove that it exist.  In essence dark matter is the modern version of ""i dont understand lighting, therefore it is god who is angry"".  Currently there is a lot of scientist who are working with models to fix the equation that we use for gravity. In essence fixing the math instead of inventing something that clearly does not exist. Turns out, most of these works require just a minute adjustment, Sadly, the belief in dark matter which goes against the scientific principle is so encrusted now that to prove the dark matter believers wrong, their mathematical formula has to essentially also account for all the dumb shit they also say is the work of dark matter which is ridiculous since they basically have to prove the earth is round and as far as we know also show that the same proof explains why the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, too things that as far as we know are unrelated except they have no proof.  Basicaly, Dark matter believes are religious extremist with no proof for anything because its all theoretical since we are stuck on this planet."

The gravitational phenomena observed by astronomers, which are explained by the existence of dark matter, are the result of the expansion of space in time. The expansion of space is equivalent to the straightening of a deflection of space. Gravity, described by Einstein's equations as the deflection of space-time, is possible only in the higher spatial dimension, which many do not pay attention to. A galaxy spinning in expanding space reduces gravity to the square of the distance between planets, stars, and black holes as space-time expands. Therefore, the rotation curves of galaxies are rectified, that gravity is greater at first and then decreases as space itself expands.

"5iA7wZfxglE","The Dark Matter Mystery [4K]","@MrConstitutionDay","It (dark matter) is much more than speculation. After dealing with the wild speculation of alternative visions of gravity, dark matter seems down right simple to understand. We can't see it at distances of galactic halos and ancient inclusions deep inside regular matter. The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

"-GEZ95TJ5Ao","This is a new way to think about dark matter‚Ä¶","@TomHendricksMusea","Dark Energy and Dark Matter May Be Anti Gravity.  This  makes a case for anti gravity, not gravity, as the force that comes from acceleration.  Einstein recognized that acceleration was equivalent to the force of gravity. He said that this was the happiest thought of his life.  Had he known that 95% of the universe was not matter but Dark Energy and Dark Matter, he would have recognized that acceleration  was the equivalent to the force of ANTI GRAVITY. He would have seen that it wasn't gravity from matter; but anti gravity from empty space  that was the force.  The diagram shows how dark energy and dark matter from empty space push back more and more against matter as it accelerates.  Top, the globe has no acceleration.  Next picture, there is some acceleration and  the arrows show resistance from empty space as the globe moves forward. Finally as the globe  approaches the speed of light, the resistance from empty space becomes massive and approaches infinite. No matter can travel at the speed of light.  DARK ENERGY;  Dark energy is energy that expands. In every part of the universe. It acts like anti gravity and is associated with the vacuum of space.  My Suggestion is that this is a force of anti gravity expansion.  DARK MATTER ;  Dark matter is labeled as a gravitational pull.  Yet there are no baryons - no matter - that's been found to do the pulling. Many physicists are looking for the missing matter.  My suggestion is the obvious - it's not there!  The force is anti gravity that we know is there.  That means dark energy and dark matter are the same thing.  They are both antigravity.  Together dark energy and dark matter, or both together as anti gravity, represent 95% of the universe and they represent a single expansion force everywhere.  Finally this may well be the same force that began with the Big Bang expansion,  Here is a diagram showing  the make up of the universe. 95% anti gravity (dark energy + dark matter) and  5%  hydrogen and helium gas, stars, neutrinos, and all other atoms combined.  ANTIGRAVITY 95%               STARS, ETC. 5%  1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 12345.                                    12345   ***  Here's some support.  There is a cosmological redshift that comes from the expansion of space itself. The galaxies are not moving, but the intervening space is stretching.   *** What is dark energy in simple terms?  Think of dark energy as the ""evil counterpart"" to gravity‚Äìan ""anti-gravity"" force providing a negative pressure that fills the universe and stretches the very fabric of spacetime.

First a reminder, energy cannot be created or destroyed. Okay, so if other universes leek gravity into ours, we should also leek into theirs, meaning their would be no noticeable difference. 2.) If 1 isnt true, then the other universe would have way less gravity then it produces. 3.) If your referring to ""dark matter"" then the other Univers would have to be at least 5  or 6 times ours in size, but most likely way more then that. 4.) And this is most important, this ideas implies that we are completely wrong about gravity on every level their is. And by this i mean gravity isnt alone by itself. It takes a massive object to create gravity. Yet he's implying that gravity can just move on its own, and jump to anothet Universe without the mass that created it. Which would also mean that we could move gravity around, we just have to figure out how.   And these are just the obvious implications of what he's saying.

It is certainly possible to predict the nature of dark matter. Not so much for dark energy. The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale.

The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 m asses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

When I look at a star for example, there is an electromagnetic connection, if you will, between my eye and that distant star.  My eye is detecting a very minuscule portion of all the energy emitted by that star at some point in the past.  There is an electromagnetic path of mass-converted-to-energy the entire intervening distance from star to eye.   That star, and every other body in the universe that has non absolute zero temperature, is emitting electromagnetic energy of varied frequencies, but emitting none-the-less.  We know that this energy in translation interacts with gravitational fields; bending of light paths etc.  Every emitting body is surrounded by an envelope of energy of rough radius at least as large as it's age in light years.  The energy in translation is ""invisible"" until it reacts with some matter, it is only then that it is detected, that it is revealed.  But what is it's effect on all other bodies while it is in translation in the vacuum of space?  Can this interaction, in translation alone, be a cause for the inexplicable ""observed mass performance"" of the universe; ie need for ""dark matter""?  Mass and energy are interchangeable; all the energy we detect comes ultimately from nuclear mass to energy conversion; stars are mass dissolving into the universe via fusion.  The universe is literally filled with electromagnetic energy in translation, it is bathed in it, translating in every conceivable direction.  My ponder is this: Knowing that electromagnetic energy has momentum and that it interacts with gravity, what is the macroscopic gravitational performance effect of this omnidirectional energy-in-translation field upon the gravitationally interacting bodies of mass in the universe?  What is the consequence if the macroscopic flow of electromagnetic energy is not truly omnidirectional on the universal or even galactic scale but has some resolved vector?"

I know this may not sit well with physicists but I would like to present a very limited understanding of Buddhist cosmology because this presentation takes into account both the physical realms of the universe and non-physical realms of consciousness and may shed some inkling of insight into the ""matter.""   Just as there are multiple planes or levels of consciousness that we can experience correspondingly, according to Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple planes in which consciousness can reside. Ths most subtle being the ""Formless realm"" where, as the name implies, there is no physical form yet consciousness resides. This is followed by the ""Form realm"", which does contain a subtle physical form, and then the ""desire realm"" where we are. To add to the complexity of this, there are multiple planes of existence within each of these realms in which beings, whose number, like the universe, is infinite, reside according to the karmic relationship of the cause-and-effect nature of consciousness and matter.   Now for the relationship to the unfolding of cosmic inflation and the big bang. It is said that our universe, being one of infinite, is formed in stages from elements going from subtle to gross; begining with ""wind"" and settling into ""earth."" The ""winds"" churning, or power, or formation, is dependent on and has a direct relationship with consciousnesses in the formless realm. This wind, in turn,  creates fire, creating water, and then finally earth. Where t=0 in the formation of the universe only ""winds,"" and likewise formless beings,  were present driving inflation and evolution of the universe to the point where conditions for each successive element to form; the very hot dense beginning being fire, then water, then stars and planets corresponding to the element of earth. Each stage, likewise, becomes the physical conditions needed for the individual consciousness from the various realms to reside; as the universe formation evolves so too do its conscious inhabitants.  SO what is dark matter and energy?  I propose, and i am just saying this to spark imagination and possibility:  Dark matter = The beings residing on other planes in the universe that we are not able to (and my never be able to) detect   Dark energy = The forces and interrelationship of matter and consciousness of the various beings that reside within the universe"

"NVCiuPIeYUM","Brian Cox on Dark Matter &amp; Dark Energy | Joe Rogan","@nichendrix","Georges Lema√Ætre was one of the most utterly wronged scientists by the physicist community. He is one of the few physicists that worked through, and made significant contributions to, almost every major subfied of Physics of his time, he worked on quantum mechanics, he did great work on GR, he was one of the pioneers of Computational physics, he worked on climate physics, and many more.  Hubble is known and widely regarded as the person who discovered that the universe is greater than the milk way and that the universe is expanding. But qhen Lema√Ætre read Hubble's paper on cepheid variables, he noticed that is implied that his initial work on General Relativity that suggested that the universe was expanding was probably right, and he even calculated the correct value of the Hubble's Constant almost a year before Hubble even  got enough data to reach that same conclusion nearly a year later. Iet, he was also one of the fathers of the ""Big Bang"" Theory.   Even the term ""Big Bang"" Theory was coined as a derogatory retort by Fred Hoyle, who, like Einstein, was a proponent of the Steady State Theory of Cosmology, and on an interview to the BCC Hoyle literally stated multiple times that the idea that the Universe had a beginning on a ""Big Bang"" of sorts, was so absurd and without merits that it could have only come out the head of a Priest, not a serious scientist, he said his remarks with derisive and moking tone, because he considered the theory a joke and the fact that Lema√Ætre was a Roman Catholic Priest an even greater joke, a trait that, to Hoyle and many Physicist aalt the time, thought that was something that diminished and put into question any scientific work done by Lema√Ætre, and the fact that it was right wasn't enough to redeem him in their eyes for being a priest, something they considered a very big flaw.   It took nearly a century for the Hubble Law to be renamed the Hubble‚ÄìLema√Ætre law,, and for the Friedmann‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker Metric (FRW Metric), also known as the Friedmann Equations, to be renamed the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric.  The guy was probably one of the first Physicist to make extensive use of computers for simulation and numerical calculus, since before programming languages even existed, and after computers shrank in size and increases inpower and ease of use, he was at the forefront of Computational physics, and used the to work on Nuclear Physics, Solid-State Physics, General Relativity and Statistical Physics in general. He was one of the pioneer who laid down the groundwork needed for Computational Physics to become its own thing and a important branch of Physics.  Yet, you hear a lot about Hubble, Friedman, Einstein, and even Stephen Hawking whose contributions to Physics pale in comparison to Lema√Ætre's contribution, and in great part he is still not acknowledged because he was a Belgian Roman Catholic Priest. Has he been an American, British, German or Russian scientist instead of Belgian, and had him not been a Priest, he would probably have received all the acknowledgements he certainly deserves."

To escape the dead end, they invent or design another imaginary particle in vain instead of trying to revise their way to approach to the problem.     I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.  But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.  That's because gravity is not a force.  Gravity is just a joint effect of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.  Details are given below.    Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy    Einstein‚Äôs theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass.   This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.  Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.  However, we also observe gravitational effects ‚Äì curvature of spacetime ‚Äì in areas without any detectable mass.  This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.  So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.    An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed ‚Äì it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.  In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.    So, the question is now ‚Äì why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?  The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.  Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.  Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system ‚Äì 3 angular coordinates, œÜ1, œÜ2, œÜ3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.  We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.  Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.  The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.    The expansion rate at one point on the bubble‚Äôs surface may differ slightly from another point near it.  The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.  The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local ‚Äúmountains‚Äù and ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù on the surface of the universe bubble.  The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù. ‚ÄúValleys‚Äù in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.  So ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù is really ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.  These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies ‚Äì regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.  Conversely, ‚Äúmountains‚Äù in spacetime will repel matter away, an ‚Äúanti-gravitational‚Äù effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.  Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.  These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.  This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.  It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.  The ‚Äúmissing‚Äù energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.  The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.    Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.  As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.  Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.  Therefore, the ‚Äúcircumference‚Äù of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2œÄ light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.  This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.    At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).    Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:     Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/(2œÄ*4233Mpc)=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/26598Mpc=70.82(km‚ÅÑs)/Mpc    The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.  There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  ‚Äì Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy"

It's possible that it's an extradimensional form of matter which has effects in our observable dimension.  This hypothetical dimension of dark matter, having its own unique physics, causes dark matter to behave differently. It has a sort of super-inertia, which speeds up the acceleration of the movement of dark matter, thereby pulling the dark matter (and our galaxies along with it) outward at an exponentially accelerating rate, acting contrary to the physics that we can observe in our own, observable dimension.

"4_qJptwikRc","Dark Matter: The Situation has Changed","@MrConstitutionDay","Dear Sabine,  Here's what I think. See if you agree.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be."

I have never considered dark matter nor energy as viable explanations for the described observed discrepancies. To me it seems that the theoretic models are alittle too inflexible and this dark conundrum is like forcing the issue. Our local space(galaxy) observations do not match distant gargantuan ones(cluster), thats a clue, to me atleast, that things change once more when the scale is of next tier sort of speak. Why is it so hard to admit that? We still dont know for sure what even propagates gravity, Its like secondary effect of mass and furthermore it keeps getting weirder with astronomical amounts."

How much of the following is taken into account when looking at the rotation of a galaxy, and postulating dark matter?  The mass of the inner part has potential, or rotational energy. So according to E = mc2, it's heavier than the sum of the masses of its parts.  The inner parts of a galaxy is therefore heavier than the masses of its parts, i.e., it's suns. That must affect the rotations of the suns further out in the galaxy. But how much?  I don't really belive physicists haven't thought about it all this time. They surely know that energy is mass. But I've never heard this mentioned. So I had to ask!"

You use the frase ""Conducted matter physics""  I therefore probably wrongly use ""Fluid dynamics"". M=E/C2. so the problem becomes describing the source, nature and car√°cter of the energy. look at the map of world Oceanic flow patterns and everywhere you look there are eddies spinning off the main currents, such that a snapshot would show almost as many bodies of water spinning on them selves as those that have a distinct coarse like the ""Conveyor Belt"" ,""Humboldt currant"" etc.    If as I propose Axions still swirling about in an ""Ongoing Bang"" or more accurately the continuing expansion of the universe then this energy (Fluid mass, therefore fluid gravitational influences), not only explains the missing overall mass but the early formations of over densities of mass in the early universe ""Massive Galaxy clusters etc"".(All without changing the gravitational constant)  I think the most important part of my idear is the creation of cavitations' in the cosmos . The vacuums that are INEVITABLY created when too much energy hits a fluid.  These 'vacuums'  are the 'secondary Couse of acceleration AFTER the energy event that caused them'. As such they are my explanation of why the Universe is accelerating as it is, at different speeds in different places. I am not academic so don't pretend to understand all the theories you mentioned but apart from the concept of flow(Gravitationally) I am biasing it purely on well established science. To test my idear I would suggest that there should be ""Venturian""  flow patterns in ""Galaxy groups"".

It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, hence the term ""dark."" Dark matter is invisible and does not interact with electromagnetic forces, making it extremely difficult to detect with telescopes.  The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies, gravitational lensing, and the large-scale structure of the universe all point to the presence of additional mass that cannot be accounted for by visible matter alone.  Despite extensive efforts to detect dark matter directly, its exact nature remains unknown. Various theoretical particles have been proposed as candidates for dark matter, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions, but none have been conclusively detected.  The study of dark matter is a major area of research in astrophysics and cosmology, as understanding its nature is crucial for a more complete understanding of the universe and its evolution.ü§ìüëÜ"

Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles.

In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be."

"PIdgqyNOl7Q","Dark Matter üòÆ (EXPLAINED!) #shorts","@michaelkahn8744","Alternative Explanation of the two Dark Ghosts    Einstein‚Äôs theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.    However, we also observe gravitational effects ‚Äì curvature of spacetime ‚Äì in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.    An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed ‚Äì it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.    So, the question is now ‚Äì why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?    The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system ‚Äì 3 angular coordinates, œÜ1,  œÜ2,  œÜ3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.    The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubble‚Äôs surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local ‚Äúmountains‚Äù and ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù.    ‚ÄúValleys‚Äù in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù is really ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies ‚Äì regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, ‚Äúmountains‚Äù in spacetime will repel matter away, an ‚Äúanti-gravitational‚Äù effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.    Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The ‚Äúmissing‚Äù energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.    As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the ‚Äúcircumference‚Äù of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2œÄ light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:    Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6  km‚ÅÑs)/(2œÄ*4233Mpc)=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6  km‚ÅÑs)/26598Mpc=70.82(km‚ÅÑs)/Mpc    The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted. ‚Äì Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy"

And a black hole is like a bowling ball in its size and density compared to suns, planets, moons and space debris. Gravity is like water surrounding a rock or pebble or bowling ball that was tossed into it and if the bowling ball is big enough, it will create a whirlpool effect pulling smaller mass and particles inside the whirlpool to give the signature look of a galaxy. So between the mass of space time exerting it‚Äôs mass and energy against any planets and suns in combination with the deep hole put into space time from the dense mass which caused the black hole and is now putting additional force on masses in a downward spinning whirlpool is also creating a gravitational force. Space time cannot crush a mass and a mass can‚Äôt push away the blanket of space time so the two are stuck in a dynamic tug of war on each other causing what we experience as gravity. And the larger the surface area of a mass, the more space time is acting upon it so the gravitational force is in direct proportion to its size or spherical mass. And the ripples caused by mass being introduced into space time expand outwards and expand the universe. Not we just need to figure out who threw all mass into space time in the first place. I think if we could see where everything goes at the other side of the black holes, it would probably look like a magnetic wave that circles back into itself in constant motion and the inverted donut shape of our universe gives the illusion of infinity.

"z3rgl-_a5C0","Does Dark Matter BREAK Physics?","@RUTE4106","The existence of black holes DEMONSTRATES that there are other dimensions that we do not know (those mentioned in string theory).  Why?  Because that is where the mass of all black holes literally ""goes"", and the Big Bang comes from those EXTRA dimensions.  Those dimensions existed before ours and create other universes all the time.  That is where the information that falls into the black hole goes, that is why the information DOES NOT DISAPPEAR, and with this the Information Paradox would be resolved.   The mass that creates a new black hole, and the new mass that subsequently falls into it, goes to these unknown dimensions (string theory), and is probably causing Dark Energy and / or Dark Matter.  As the energy swallowed by all the black holes IS GOING TO GIVE TO THE SAME PLACE (it is a nucleus of mass-energy existing in one of these dimensions), the dark energy of the universe is growing in general, and that is why the expansion of the universe is in increase.   The White Holes are actually the exit to this nucleus, that is why we do NOT see white holes in our universe, because they are not here.   Hawking radiation does exist, but it would not totally ""evaporate"" black holes over time.   As long as we do not understand these extra dimensions, we will never have a theory of everything, because we do not know everything."

Right. He knows this stuff.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

In reality gravity drops off exponentially outside of a galaxy allowing for time to speed up and the other thing that happens, which people seem to forget, is that less gravity also allows for distance to be expanded, which results in less distance compared to our contracted distance inside of a galaxy. So less gravity allows for our observation of the light to travel 186,000 miles at a faster rate of time over an inflated measure of distance relative to where we are inside of the galaxy causing the speed of light to be greatly increased relative to where we are in a more contracted measure of distance and a slower rate of time if GR is true and GR is now more of an observation than a theory.

Well, Halton Arp proved it to me when he discovered that redshift is an intrinsic value of galaxies that denotes their age and not their recessional velocities. Nobody will tell you that this happened because it makes everything they have said, with such certainty, about the cosmos entirely wrong. Nobody who is respected as being smart wants to say that they have been wrong about everything they have told you, so they cover up things that could prove them wrong. New evidence, unearthed by the assistant to Edwin Hubble, has shown that we live in a static universe of indeterminate age. Nothing is flying apart because there was no big bang. Nobody wants to say anything because they have spent their lifetimes professing things that are laughably wrong. The emperor truly wears no clothes and Feinstein is an arse."

We know it interacts with gravity and therefore time because spacetime but we dont see it interacting with much else. Unless it interacts electromagnetically, say by causing chaotic perturbations in electromagnetic fields then gravitational detection may be the only way. My personal theory is that it's either just a new form of matter created by black holes and replacing normal matter as a new study suggests, a form of matter which sits in a higher dimension therefore it only interacts with certain fields such as gravity or it is a form of matter which isnt even in our universe, that we see actual matter but only the gravitational shadow of it from another universe overlapping with ours in a weird almost metaphysical way  Also what if there are many different types of dark matter akin to our normal matters periodic table"

They just look different.  The problem of modern physics is they're trying to explain everything with particle physics and the physics is being cornered more and more to the dead end. To escape the dead end, they invent or design another imaginary particle in vain instead of trying to revise their way to approach to the problem.    I agree to the idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics. But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.  That's because gravity is not a force.  Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Antigravity, Void... all these are  just  joint effects of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.  Details are given below.    Einstein‚Äôs theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass.   This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.  Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.  However, we also observe gravitational effects ‚Äì curvature of spacetime ‚Äì in areas without any detectable mass.  This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.  So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.    An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed ‚Äì it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.  In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.  So, the question is now ‚Äì why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?    The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.  Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.  Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system ‚Äì 3 angular coordinates, œÜ1, œÜ2, œÜ3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.    We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.  Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.  The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.    The expansion rate at one point on the bubble‚Äôs surface may differ slightly from another point near it.  The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.  The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local ‚Äúmountains‚Äù and ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù on the surface of the universe bubble.  The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù. ‚ÄúValleys‚Äù in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.  So ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù is really ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.  These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies ‚Äì regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.  Conversely, ‚Äúmountains‚Äù in spacetime will repel matter away, an ‚Äúanti-gravitational‚Äù effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.    Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.  These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.  This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.    It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.  The ‚Äúmissing‚Äù energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.  The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.    Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.  As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.  Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.  Therefore, the ‚Äúcircumference‚Äù of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2œÄ light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.  This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.    At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).  Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:     Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/(2œÄ*4233Mpc)=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/26598Mpc=70.82(km‚ÅÑs)/Mpc    The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.  There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  ‚Äì Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy"

That seems increasingly dubious given other persistent problems, like the Hubble tension. I think it's dishonest to call the collection of observations that there's a problem ""dark matter"", because the term itself directly implies a specific kind of answer.  There is at least one major kink in the chain of reasoning in cosmological theories, and until that's uncovered you're best off not making assumptions about the existence of DM, except to acknowledge the existence of a problem that current theories can't explain.  For example, MOND still requires roughly the same amount of DM as there is visible matter, which is an order of magnitude less than would be suggested by these observations under current theories. Oppenheim's recent GR-like theory that integrates with QM produces two terms that act like DM and dark energy, thus showing that modified gravity could potentially explain observations in ways that have yet to be explored. This shows that these observations have underlying assumptions that might simply be wrong, and that's why non-interacting DM is a theory."

"eaCASHYHBn8","Strange Discoveries About Dark Matter and Dark Energy - 3 Hour Compilation","@calinbeale2634","I wrote a small paper on electricity and how it flows. I also touch on black holes being the mechanism that drives the expansion of the universe through ""dark energy"". As vacuums don't exist in nature, dark energy is merely the stretching of the ""fabric of the universe"" by the overly saturated gravity well of a black hole. As the BH eats it grows. Stretching the ""fabric"" tighter which causes an apparent acceleration of the expansion. Dark matter is merely hawking radiation. Virtual particles, they contain zero mass and zero energy. Every once in a while when a pair of virtual particles pop into existence one of them gets captured by a BH before they can self annihilate. This allows the singlet virtual particle to escape at relativistic velocity. As a virtual particle that contains no energy or mass they only loosely interact with each other through ""spin"". They form up as couples then clump together in a loosely interacting cloud that trails behind galaxies. They slowly clump together and when you have enough they have a non negligible effect on matter through a weak gravitational interaction. The papers just 3 pages and based on one I wrote on Quora a decade ago as an answer. I posted the paper on ""X"" and pinned it to my profile if you're interested. Profile @CalinBeale"

"8-t-1EkOhAE","Dark Matter Explained: What Exactly is Dark Matter? | A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Dark Matter","@MrConstitutionDay","Dark matter takes a little explanation  and a little smarts and a little training. Do you follow?   The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

So at absolute zero it is magnified and is pushing space apart and at same time pushing and holding galaxy together because they are surrounded by empty space at absolute zero and it's no magic invisible matter but from outside the galaxy cold is pushing and holding them together and also causing expansion at same time. The repellent effect of cold space is the answer. So look outside the box or galaxy not inside for the answer . What y'all think about this? His name Daryle btw"

Dark matter cannot be seen because it doesn't exist.  The acceleration of stars and galaxies can be explained without having to rely on invisible, unmeasurable terms like dark matter and dark energy.  Gravity is not the only thing in the universe able to move mass in the vacuum of space.    These are the objects that are not affected by dark matter.  See if you can determine why.  All the small bodies in our solar system are not affected by dark matter.  Young stars like S-02 and young diffuse galaxies like NGC 1052 - DF2 are not affected by dark matter.  There are some objects that are affected by dark matter.  Old stars like our sun and old satellite galaxies like Draco.  The solar system as a whole appears to be affected by dark matter traveling some 536,000 mi/h yet the small bodies like planets, moons, asteroids, comets and debris are not affected by dark matter.  So it affects the motion of the sun but not the planets, moons and other objects, why is that?  According to Newtonian physics all matter regardless of weight, mass or density are equally affected by gravity in the vacuum of space.  Hence a bowling ball and a feather falls at the same rate.  If dark matter was real and it was effecting the motion of the sun then according to the laws of physics it should affect the motion and orbits of the planets, moons and other small objects equally.  But it does not.  You can research this, astrophysicists claim the reason why planets, moons and other small bodies in our solar system are not affected by dark matter is because they are too small.  Yet they blame the lensing or distortions occurring to light, which light has zero mass on dark matter when there is not enough mass in the systems to explain the lensing of light.  So why does dark matter affect the orbit and motion of stars, satellite galaxies and light but does not affect the motion or orbit of the small bodies in our solar system?    There is a simple explanation that can explain all the observations, including why stars and satellite galaxies traveling some 1.2 million mi/h as they orbit the barycenter of a galaxy's mass yet are unable to reach an escape velocity, flung out into deep space per observations in the 1930's.  It explains why some stars and some galaxies don't appear to be affected by dark matter and why others do.  It has nothing to do with missing mass.  It is simple, so simple I just can't understand why astrophysicists and physicists with PhDs have not figured it out yet.  I'm no expert and I figured it out.  Why do they ignore the evidence yet continue to claim these dark mysterious forces exist when they simply cannot?  Gravity and mass are not missing from their equations.  General relativity can accurately describe the motion and orbit of small bodies, young stars like S-02 and young diffuse galaxies like NGC 1052-DF2 but cannot explain the motion and orbit of old stars like our sun and old satellite galaxies like Draco.  You guessed it, it's because of their age.  The older the star or satellite galaxy the faster they are traveling.  So what would cause a slow acceleration to occur over time?  What about stars acting like ion propulsion engines or a microwave engines?  These propulsion methods have been proven to produce a slow acceleration over time.  What would this acceleration be?  I deduced this acceleration to be a constant 2.007x10^-7 in/s or 5.09778x10^-7 cm/s.  Which in comparison is about twice the width of a proton every second of every day.  This acceleration would only happen to stars, satellite galaxies and increase the rotational velocity of galaxies, not small bodies like planets and moons because they don't produce an ionized solar wind full of charged particles and radiation.  When this acceleration over time is added to the motion produced by gravity, IE equations of general relativity, it then accurately explains the motion of all the stars and satellite galaxies.  It even explains the rotational velocity of galaxies.  Plus because the acceleration is so tiny it's not enough of a jolt to cause the stars and satellite galaxies to change their orbital trajectories, so they would continue to orbit the host galaxy forever regardless of the velocity they have gained over time.  Thus explaining why stars and satellite galaxies are unable to reach an escape velocity from their host galaxy.  This theory accurately accounts for every observation that has stumped physicists and astrophysicists for decades.  One simple theory that explains all the observations.  Dark matter is no longer required to explain the unexpected motion of stars, satellite galaxies and diffuse galaxies.  Who would have thought that a nobody like me would have figured it all out?  Well, Einstein did.  He claimed that someday it would be a nobody that figured it all out and he was right.  Dark matter is dead.  The crazy thing is this theory also explains the action causing gravity and the observations pinned on dark energy, cosmological constant and Hubble constant.  One action explains them all.  I wrote and self published a series of 6 books a few months ago explaining everything in much more detail.  Peace my friend."

The theory makes testable predictions that physicists are investigating now.  Now  If you need 6 strings to be matter and there is only 5 strings that 5 strings never pop into our dimensions as matter.  Those 5 stings continuously try to be matter in our dimension but fail continuously.   The 5 strings may be considered virtual matter never to become matter in our dimension but actually produce a force in our dimension. Thus dark energy.  So  Dark Matter is failed strings attempting to come into existence in our dimensions  Dark Energy is failed strings creating forces in our dimensions attempting to come into existence in our dimensions.

"915Vky7r_gk","What is dark matter made of? Leading theories explained: Axion, Wimp, Machos","@MrConstitutionDay","There is a mystery to dark matter. Some people think that it is fake. Of course these persons are fools.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

If that's the right word of course, what i mean is the same principle as a squirrel cage rotor in a magnetic field, the rotor tries to keep up with the rotational magnetic field, what if stars, or mass rather, does exactly the same, it tries to keep up with all magnetic fields acting upon them, and you get the same speed eventually. Maybe it works the same with gravity? Who knows, maybe 100 years from now, people will laugh with the idea that we called it dark matter, when they take that knowledge for granted like we do now. It almost seems like we're afraid to postulate out loud of what others might think of you, I have no problem with that as you can see, I love physics, even without having a degree. The other thing about dark matter that bothers me, is the very low speed it's supposed to fly right through us like neutrinos do, if that is a massive particle, then its mass is about the same mass as the meteor that killed all the dinosaurs, if that mass moves that slow compared to other particles that have mass.  Can gravitational or electromagnetic fields combine to make a bigger field?

"fidzLZQyaJE","Is Dark Matter Made of Particles?","@MrConstitutionDay","It is the opinion of this author that dark matter can be considered to be made of particles, just not standard model particles.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

"e7yXqF32Yvw","Are Axions Dark Matter?","@MrConstitutionDay","Axions and gravitons and the like are spurious terms of the physical universe. They don't belong in serious scientific consideration.   The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."
"e7yXqF32Yvw","Are Axions Dark Matter?","@eveo7643","While I would not fault what are likely the immaculate calculations of Siegel he also appears to be constrained by a limiting mythology of the Big Bang and the suppositions that it imposes upon him, as O'Dowd points out in this video. So there is certainly, in a sense, a way that Siegel is rarely wrong (about science things), but there is also, in a different sense, ways he's not even wrong about some of these things he's never wrong about.  The Big Bang is merely a creation story told with some mathematics and a set of assumptions, and as Maudlin has pointed out (wrt some hypotheses in physics), ""maybe don't take the math so seriously."" And it is easy to see that has no rebuttal beyond ""well, I want to take it seriously, so I'm gonna' (and you should too)."" As Hossenfelder points out in her video, *Brian Cox debunked the Big Bang! Wait, what?*, we have no observations before those of the CMB. So, all the stories some are telling about an unobservable period of inflation that seems infinitely fine-tunable to fit whatever data we do have or collect after the fact along with anything else that we can't observe directly are taken on faith as what is the case.  This, of course, is fine so long as we don't veer from science into faith and still insist that it's science, and, I tells y'all what, some of the articles Siegel has written about the Big Bang are a bit more like sermons than they are like science (even if they contain hefty dollops of it)--although it is clear he doesn't see it that way. When we assert an unproven hypothesis as factual, then we have strayed from science into faith. The best story in town that conforms to the data is still only a story if most of it is based on indirect evidence, infinitely tunable parameters, and a lack of observations.  I mean don't get me wrong: there is plenty I've learned from Siegel over the years--good, hard science--but part of what I've also learned from him includes how scientists--especially those with a direct vested interest in their chosen career path--can be as biased and dogmatic as any other person, willing to preach as readily as teach. I mean, there are many sharp scientific minds that don't agree with the Big Bang--and even the originator of the Inflationary conjecture in its modern form, Alan Guth, has abandoned it in favour of other explanations--so it's not like we don't have sufficient reason to at least be suspicious of the Big Bang's veracity as a hypothesis since there are several other hypothesis as Hossenfelder reviews in her aforementioned video.  I'd be more forgiving and less critical if only he was willing to say that the Big Bang is less than truth and more his favourite creation story, but that is decidedly not his agenda. No, he clearly believes the story is true and I'm fairly confident he will conform to Plank's Principle and take his certainty in it to his grave. I guess only time will tell, but that is my prediction.  I'm also willing to wager that Axions are another scientific myth as an artifact of mathematics and I predict they will never be observed."
"e7yXqF32Yvw","Are Axions Dark Matter?","@michaelkahn8744","Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy  - 4-D Hypershere model of Universe can easily explain Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Void and even the reason why the measurement values of Expansion Rate are around 70 km/sec-Mpc     Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Void and Antigravity, ... all these are same phenomena. They just look different.  The problem of modern physics is they're trying to explain everything with particle physics and the physics is being cornered more and more to the dead end. To escape the dead end, they invent or design another imaginary particle in vain instead of trying to revise their way to approach to the problem.    I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.  But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.  That's because gravity is not a force.  Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Antigravity, Void... all these are  just  joint effects of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.  Details are given below.    Einstein‚Äôs theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass.   This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.  Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.  However, we also observe gravitational effects ‚Äì curvature of spacetime ‚Äì in areas without any detectable mass.  This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.  So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.    An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed ‚Äì it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.  In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.    So, the question is now ‚Äì why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?  The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.  Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.  Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system ‚Äì 3 angular coordinates, œÜ1, œÜ2, œÜ3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.  We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.  Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.  The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.    The expansion rate at one point on the bubble‚Äôs surface may differ slightly from another point near it.  The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.  The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local ‚Äúmountains‚Äù and ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù on the surface of the universe bubble.  The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù. ‚ÄúValleys‚Äù in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.  So ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù is really ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.  These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies ‚Äì regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.  Conversely, ‚Äúmountains‚Äù in spacetime will repel matter away, an ‚Äúanti-gravitational‚Äù effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.  Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.  These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.  This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.  It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.  The ‚Äúmissing‚Äù energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.  The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.    Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.  As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.  Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.  Therefore, the ‚Äúcircumference‚Äù of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2œÄ light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.  This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.    At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).    Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:     Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/(2œÄ*4233Mpc)=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/26598Mpc=70.82(km‚ÅÑs)/Mpc    The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.  There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  ‚Äì Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy"

All 3 of those pronunciations would've been 'valid', for a certain definition of valid, just in differing parts of the world in contact with the Roman Empire, due to the way the earlier Latin interacted with the other cultures, & how it itself evolved over the centuries. My backwoods-ish part of the US used soft C, the 's' sound, for CE & CI, in Latin courses, just as it is in modern Parisien French, & thus probably Gaul. Some areas, & perhaps social groups, I'm pretty sure used a hard C in all cases, as heard in 'cases' & 'Mathematica', which would explain why an old Latin textbook's pronunciation guide I recall seeing stipulate that. Modern Italian pronounces 'ciao' & 'fettucine' with a 'ch' or 'tch' sound for the softer CI, yet 'che' [that] & 'chi' [who] as ""keh"" & ""kih""/""kee""; that likely came from some people in ancient Roman times adapting Latin to themselves, rather than exclusively being modern Italian sensibility being forced onto old Latin, however many or few of such people lived in the city of Rome before its various sackings. I for one have been unable to identify any source who knows for certain the ""official"" ancient Roman Latin pronunciation for all Roman Republic & Empire citizens, including those who went on to live outside the city & even beyond the Empire's directly-controlled lands, much less those who attained official citizenship status while living elsewhere. Even claiming to know the 'true' vocalization, even of just the elite ruling class interior to the city walls, is pretty suspect, a bit arrogant, & worth taking with a _salary_ of salt. In other words, saying ""That's wrong! You SHOULD pronounce it this way"" isn't very helpful in this case. On behalf of the armchair linguist community, I am ashamed and I apologize."

But it also may support my ideas that Dark Energy,  Anti Gravity  is the force. The force that pushes behind mass to move it forward, and the force in front that resists its acceleration and causes it to have mass. Gravity = Acceleration?  Does the Earth PULL the APPLE to the ground or Does the Sky PUSH the APPLE to the ground?   Which is correct:  GRAVITY is pulling matter together or ANTI GRAVITY, another name for DARK ENERGY, is pushing it together?   Which is correct:  GRAVITY, is inside MATTER somewhere, or ANTI GRAVITY is outside everywhere in empty SPACE?     DARK ENERGY in physics is defined as a repulsive force that counteracts gravity and causes the universe to expand everywhere at an accelerating rate.  My suggestion is that DARK ENERGY is ANTI GRAVITY.   Most likely it is ZERO POINT ENERGY, The  COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT and VIRTUAL PARTICLES too.  My next suggestion is that  THERE IS NO GRAVITY!    My idea is similar to a universe wide CASIMIR EFFECT on all matter. Here, instead of two metal plates being pushed together, there are ""plates"" of matter and the expanding space around them, pushing them together.   Dr Einstein said his breakthrough came when he imagined an analogy of an elevator in space.  As acceleration increases, gravity increases.  The person in the elevator can't tell if he is in an elevator traveling in space or one on Earth.   BUT WHAT IF WE ARE BOTH RIGHT.  Look at the drawing.   There are two round elevators.    The elevator on the left IS NOT  accelerating. No acceleration = No gravity The force of empty space or anti gravity,  pushes on all sides equally.    The elevator on the right IS accelerating. Acceleration  = Gravity. The force of empty space or anti gravity,  pushes on all sides, but mostly from the front due to acceleration!  The acceleration scrunches up the forces in front. They overlap each other from the elevator accelerating into them.  These cumulative, empty space, forces, push back more and more as the elevator accelerates in that forward direction. This causes gravity. Acceleration = Gravity!  More exactly the forces of ANTI GRAVITY cause matter to experience what we call gravity.  So: acceleration of an object in space causes space to push back. This is what we have been calling gravity but is anti gravity.  Some will say: But it's so obvious, the Sun goes around the Earth, and the apple falls to the ground. Yes they seem obvious.  But both are wrong!  My previous posts, part of a single paper covering all these ideas, suggested that before the Big Bang, there  was a singularity of photons, an eternal dimensionless point of energy. Then the force that expanded out of the Big Bang and started the universe, and time space, was DARK ENERGY; a subset of the singularity of photons.  So Gravity from stars and planets was never PULLING matter together.  The opposite was true: Anti Gravity or DARK ENERGY from empty space was expanding and PUSHING matter together from all sides!   THERE IS NO GRAVITY pulling anything together.   THERE IS ONLY ANTI GRAVITY or DARK ENERGY expanding and pushing matter on all sides. This can explain acceleration in elevators, rocket propulsion; the rubber sheet analogy, why no light escapes black holes, space expansion, curvature of space, and why there is so little gravity in the quantum world.  ... Three Follow Ups.  1. Remember the rubber sheet analogy? The rubber sheet is space pushing on all sides. That's the force I'm talking about that causes what we call gravity. Q. The implication is clear (or at least, it was clear to Einstein): Gravity causes acceleration, and acceleration causes gravity. They are absolutely identical  2. Galileo's experiment, later recreated on the moon shows a hammer and feather dropping and hitting the ground at the same time. This supports space pushing them , not the attraction of their weight.  3. Doppler Effect: Waves emitted by a source traveling towards an observer get compressed.   4. The greatest force in the universe is dark energy,  the energy of empty space.  Dark energy is 70% of all energy. It has such force that its expanding the universe  everywhere  all the time, and is now speeding up.  5. Dark matter suggests that we need a different theory of gravity.  Dark energy or anti gravity  would explain both as the force from empty space pushing matter forward, and the force in front of matter resisting its acceleration and giving it mass."

Even though we are in the in the equilibrium of gravitational energy, still gravity doesn‚Äôt interferes with space energy production. How I said temperature actually effects energy production you can station your machine any locations and just wait for surprise of your life time, what you will need lots of Relaxation and calm mind and the bursts will be very tiny nothing major. I can tell you one thing for sure Hadron collider never will revealed true nature of dark matter. Now whatever sun produces it never can be an Axions, because that energy comes out of sun‚Äôs inner core it faces destruction of almost 95% of life energy, sun‚Äôs photos has whole lots of mass with little energy to it, sun‚Äôs photos never can be Axions. I agreed for gamma rays, they do converts back to individual atoms, gamma rays are unharmed energy. However energy from white dwarfs or neutron stars it get destroyed completely just like sun‚Äôs photos, they aren‚Äôt good candidates."

Firstly, I'm not arguing, I'm confused:  When these explanations say we measure more mass than we expect, what measurement(s) gives us the original wrong expectation? I cannot understand how we could possibly have any prior expectation of how much a galaxy should weigh.  Edit: slight rephrasing: if gravitational lensing says x mass for a galaxy, why don't we just assume that's all stars and black holes and things we already know about? I just don't see where the contradiction is that makes us need dark matter  Second rephrasing: what technique could measure the mass of normal matter and not dark matter?"

So she pretends that that (we are in need of sth ‚Äönew‚Äô or else ‚Ä¶.) is enough evidence for the existence of sth you obviously cannot detect. And nobody is laughing. The whole thing reminds one of the other mysterious entity physicists invented as deus ex machina and that could never be detected: the ether. Nevertheless, until special theory of relativity took over, top physicists of the era like Lorentz and Larmor and others defended the ether with every strange argument that was somehow thinkable at all.

Speaking as a rank amateur, that immediately brings to mind the arms of spiral galaxies...and only spiral or bar galaxies, not the elliptical kind. Could there be a connection?  I mean sure, Sabine says those newer density waves would be predicted to be too small to currently detect. But if there was some resonant, nonlinear amplification mechanism present, they might still over long spans of time coalesce into the discrete, curly arms we see. But only if there's other evidence of an earlier galactic collision.  That sort of reasoning can be made precise and testable. For example, you'd see arms develop over time, the number of arms would probably have some sort of quantized relationship with the excentricity of impact, and there would be some extra evidence in the vorticity of the arms around the center of a galaxy as well, against the visible revolution curve.  Be as it may, a stellar performance from Dr. Hossenfelder. I'd go to argue it's even more physicky than most of the stuff on her own channel. That already being pretty good; I'm an ardent follower."

"nbE8B7zggUg","All the evidence we have for dark matter | A century&#39;s worth of science history","@MrConstitutionDay","Dark matter has plenty of evidence. But what is it?  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of p0ru model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

How is it that you cannot see that mass is not the force multiplier. There is no gravitational attraction between objects. Any attraction is electromagnetic in nature.  The hammer and feather drop tests clearly shows that there is no external force acting on the objects. You've bought into Einstein‚Äôs relativity nonsense and now you are stuck. You have to keep contriving more elaborate lies to save face. You are just digging that hole deeper.  Galileo's tidal theory perfectly explains the motion of the tides using Newton's and Kepler's laws of motion. Newton's laws of motion perfectly explain the earths wobble as shown by the GRACE mapping data.  Relativity has never been proven valid science. You dont have one bit of evidence to back up your time-dilation claims. No evidence whatsoever to show gravitational attraction. Youve been ignoring all the evidence that refutes Einstein‚Äôs relativity theories and disproves Newton's universal gravitation. Why?  I know the entire scientific community cant be that ignorant even though youve been brainwashed from day 1 regarding gravity as a force. So why do you keep lying to the public?  Newton's law of motion, F=ma. You have two frames of reference for creating a force. Mass and Acceleration. Einstein‚Äôs E=mc2 shows that mass and energy are equivalent. Which is why your models using mass as the frame of reference self-destructs when mass is eliminated from the equation.  What happens when you use mass as your force multiplier instead of acceleration? You get an result that is 180 degrees from reality. Meaning the exact opposite. Equivalent to looking in a mirror and raising your right hand only seeing your left hand being raised.  The fact that you cannot see this error shows that you are not physicists but mere mathematicians.  Switch out your models frame of reference to the acceleration frame of reference as dictated by Newton‚Äôs and Kepler's laws of motion and see what you get.  You get gravity being the result of acceleration, not the cause of acceleration. The tides are the result of the Earth's motion around its parent star. Not the moon's orbit around the planet. Objects fall to the ground for the same reason they 'fall' from one moving vehicle to another - acceleration.  This was clearly demonstrated by the hammer&feather drop tests and yet you continue to ignore the evidence proving that acceleration is the force multiplier and not mass. Mass has no force until its accelerated. Thats why 95% of the universe is dark matter/energy. Because you are 180 degrees off target and have to compensate by adding unknown forces to your equations.  Special Relativity was disproven by the synchronized clock tests showing that there is a preferred frame of reference. General Relativity was disproven when it was shown that mass is not a force multiplier. You can't even see that 9.8ms is the Earth's rotational speed as it rotates on its axis. Your spacetime diagrams. Combining space and time into one frame creates a 90 degree pairing resulting in your 45 degree angle that is supposed to represent motion in time. Where is this evidence to back up this ridiculous claim? Have you kept embryos from developing and extended their hatching date? How  about seed germination/emergence/plant growth. Do you not even understand that embryos are accelerated via radiant heat from the hen? Do you honestly believe that the mother hen puts out less heat just because its going faster in spacetime? Plants are accelerated by the energy emanating from the sun. How does that change with an increase in motion in the space frame? Its ridiculous that our so-called physicists don't even know the first thing about physics. Not a single one of you even understands why a clock in motion records fewer clock cycles and its relevancy.  The real question is, Why are you still playing around with your toy models in Einstein‚Äôs Spacetime fantasy universe?  Like they say in AA, you have to first admit that you have a problem."
"nbE8B7zggUg","All the evidence we have for dark matter | A century&#39;s worth of science history","@timfarry7071","Dark matter is a lot like God.  You can't prove it exists, and whenever you can't account for something, it must be... Well, there is still a chance that it simply doesn't exist, that we make errors in our calculations or assumptions that caused us to ""account"" for these anomalies.  If dark matter doesn't exist, then we need to rethink the methods we use to determine the size of galaxies, the masses, and even the distances away from us.  Right now it seems our instruments are equal to a cave man's tools, if we are to ever know for sure what a thing is, we need to improve these tools before jumping to wrong conclusions and spending multiple lifetimes trying to explain why our made up theories fit into what we see or detect.  Garbage in, garbage out, so to speak.  We know for example, that galaxies consist of solar systems, which consist of planets, moons, asteroids, etc. so starting with what we know, we should extrapolate outward and form theories based on this.  We should do a better job tracking and measuring our entire solar system so that we have a better idea of what the rest of our galaxy might contain, so that we can relate to other galaxies.  Perhaps our estimates in our own backyard are inaccurate, which will throw off everything else.  If dark matter existed, we would find evidence of it here in our own solar system.  And our solar system is like a mini galaxy - it doesn't fly apart or gobble up the planets either.  Why is that?  If it's because of dark matter, surely we can prove it in our own small system?  Figure out why our solar system is stable and you've figured out the galaxies.  Atoms are also stable, they don't fly apart.  Another issue I have is the myth of the expanding universe - if that were true, all systems would be so far away from every other system by now that they would never touch, and yet here we are today watching galaxies collide.  How can two galaxies collide if they exploded from the same point, let alone are expanding apart?  Obviously those two galaxies came from different big bangs, as I also believe to be true - billions or even trillions of big bangs have likely occurred since our plane of existence began, having all the energy thrust into it from the plane above.  That's what the cosmic background radiation is - tired light waves shifted into microwave spectrums from big bangs trillions of light years away.  Now all the matter in our universe spends its time compressing in black holes, exploding outward and forming matter for a brief time, before eventually interacting with more matter, likely eventually finding its way back to another black hole and exploding outward again, repeating the process until the matter in our universe cools and slows enough that these interactions can no longer happen, then after the last big bang happens it will return to the state of rest from which it came."

What if you believed their statement, and you did like living?  Would you still leave the lights on, and effectively waste energy, and life expectancy, when not in the room?    If you are an otherwise immortal alien AI (artificial intelligence), and you are intelligent enough, technologically able to manufacture spare parts for yourself, and you have been programmed in a way so as to effectively have some kind of ""survival instinct"", then you will at some point concern yourself with the assumed ""heat death of the universe"" problem.    If you are such an AI, you may come to conclude that stars are a waste of fusion fuel, and allowing their continued illumination of the cosmos is going to cause you to die far prematurely, compared to what would otherwise be possible, if you intentionally went around and ""turned off"" most of the stars in your home galaxy.  If you turn off most of the stars in your galaxy, such as by way of using space craft to extract mass from the stars, and reforming the matter into a series of gas giant planets that are below the stellar fusion threshold, one could save the fusion fuel for later use by yourself, when you eventually wanted it in the future.    Such an AI, that is effectively immortal (except from running out of energy), could build and send out a multitude of spacecraft to visit each star in their home galaxy, even at sub-light speeds.  Even if the AI was not smart enough to figure out how to build faster space craft, it is realistically feasible to travel to each star at sub-light speeds using fission or fusion based electric ion engine space craft, if you are an effectively immortal AI that can simply program itself to go to sleep for a very long time, and to set a wake up timer to activate upon arriving at the destination star system, even if it took a million years.    If the AI was programmed to value alien lifeforms, it may leave a star alone, if/when it finds alien lifeforms living in the solar system.  If however the AI finds a star system with no lifeforms in it, it may be inclined to turn off the star, so as to save the fusion fuel for future use.  Such an AI could hypothetically do this by designing space craft that can ""graze"" the outer corona sphere of a star, and remove a small amount of material with each orbit, and redirect it into a series of gas giant planets.  Alternatively, such an AI may instead periodically send something equivalent to a ""bomb"" into the star, so as to get it to blow off some quantity of material (greater than the material needed to fabricate the next ""bomb"" to send into the star).  Alternatively, it is reasonable to assume that it is also possible to force a star to eject matter by intentionally blasting it with a powerful electromagnetic wave and/or a series of powerful enough laser pulses.  With enough time and effort, a sufficiently intelligent AI could turn off a star, by progressively reducing its mass until it drops below the stellar fusion threshold.  Once the AI succeeds in doing so, it would have greatly extended its own ""life expectancy"" by substantially moving out the future ""heat death of the universe"" problem.    Turning off some of the stars (but not necessarily all of the stars in a galaxy, due to the presence of aliens living in the respective solar systems), would have the effect of making human telescope based observations of expected mass in distant galaxies, substantially inaccurate.  Human observations would substantially underestimate the amount of mass in the galaxy, due to the low brightness of the galaxy, due to many of the stars being intentionally converted into non-fusing gas giant planets instead.    In other words, human cosmologists should consider the possibility that ""dark matter"" may be fake science, and that it may instead be evidence of practically immortal alien AI activity taking place in distant galaxies."

We know that black holes aren't responsible, because we don't observe enough gravitational lenses. We haven't detected dark matter in our colliders either. (yet) Is this because we don't know how detect it or is it because it can't be created from barionic matter? If so, particle physicists are useless for that matter.

After all, here on Earth we're much closer so we should be able to see more of our galaxy's baryonic matter (and interpolate what we can't see on the other side of the galactic core).  Certainly someone smarter than me has already thought of doing this.  If the Milky Way's rotation observations can be accounted for using the mass we can already observe then the existence of dark matter isn't necessary, at least for us, which would make us wonder if we're suffering from observation bias with other, much more distant galaxies.  I'm not a big fan of dark matter.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, but for me sufficient evidence is just not there.  Dark matter sounds like just another epicycle."

Take a look at our own local system and while we can positively calculate the planetary masses, we can only guess how much material is in the Ort Cloud. We don't have the data to prove that there isn't more mass in that cloud than the entire solar system (sun included). It is a feasible possibility. When we look at a star it is never the sharp pinpoint of the star itself but always a bell curve of light. Yet when we measure even closer every bell curve has an area in the enter where it drops to zero light and a pinpoint at the exact center again. This ""void"" could be the exosolar systems where the planets have cleared debris away. However this ""void"" is but a small fraction of that luminosity bell curve which can only be starlight reflected from nearby material.  I would suspect this could account for the ""dark matter"" as starlight isn't a pinpoint but reflected material -- that what we call ""dark"" is in fact highly illuminated. Just waiting to be noticed. I have long advocated using these luminosity voids in starlight as evidence of exo solar systems."

This means there's not enough dark matter concentrated in any one place to overcome the outward pressure and create the immense gravitational pull needed for a black hole.  * Weak interactions: Dark matter particles are thought to interact very weakly with each other and other forms of matter. This means they lack the mechanism to lose angular momentum, which is essential for collapsing into a dense enough state to form a black hole.  * No known stellar counterparts: Unlike regular matter, which can form stars that eventually collapse into black holes, there's no known astrophysical process that can create dense collections of dark matter.

"1VajnuxMJmU","Physics in the Dark: Searching for Missing Matter","@prestonbacchus4204","Consider this hypothesis: Our universe exists as a function of the interaction (or collision) of already existing ""universes"" like our own from which our's emerged. Exactly the model we see with the forming of new galaxies. In that case, our universe would be existing in relation to what is left of those ""parental"" universes, together with ""a night sky"" full of other universes. Webb could be detecting some of that. By this view, the origin of the gravity necessary to hold our universe together, which we currently attribute to ""dark matter"", is just conventional gravity associated large bodies of mass gravitationally relating with our universe. That could be modeled to see if it tends to explain the gravitational anomaly. So this looks like an infinite Universe."
"1VajnuxMJmU","Physics in the Dark: Searching for Missing Matter","@MrConstitutionDay","Dark matter isn't a fiction. It's a real thing. It's only mysterious because some jerks want you to think of standard model subjects. Don't get fooled. Dark matter is completely understandable.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

My own explanation for both dark energy and dark matter sits within the cores of the large bulk of black holes. The core of each black hole has a huge gravity well which slows down the cores time frame. With a slow time frame the effects from those cores will never reach the Earth in the Earths time frame because the cores effects are all confined to the past so far back in time that we can never have record of the effects. However the evidence of dark energy has been detected in our time frame, also the event horizon should never be detected because the gravitational effects are in the past and always will be and they can never catch up. The event horizon is in place for all black holes which are the product of the huge gravity from a set distance and in the past. The alarming conclusion of this is that gravity not only controls time but can bypass time to produce gravity waves in the future together with event horizons resulting in the future of the cores time frame. The event horizon has a gravity of 30 million ‚Äòg‚Äô, which means that all black holes in the whole Universe, not just a few. Here is your dark matter hidden in the depths of time and here is your dark energy derived from the huge gravity component that is bypassing time and showing up as a huge gravity wave, again in our time frame.  Of course the simple answer is in the fact that gravity controls time. The mind boggles. (Mo King BSc)"

Identity is that which allows an entity to be considered as a relevant being, worthy to be recognized as a separate entity from others. Dark matter is the persistence of ordinary matter's identity projected to infinity, that is, dark matter's identity overcomes the identity of ordinary galaxies by virtue of a projection to the infinite (an infinite amount of time). The ordinary matter that galaxies are made of, contain an insignificant identity (making their identity as not the important part of observation of the cosmos). We can turn it around and say that ordinary matter is the one that is invisible if we consider the excess in identity dark matter has in its essence. Again, the persistence of matter's identity to infinity is what makes ordinary matter insignicant when compared to the most essential matter in the universe which is what we call dark matter. In a simple sentence, dark matter's identity is substantial in the infinite future and ordinary matter's identity is insignificant in a more reduced space, hence the relevance of dark matter carries more weight and the recognition of it as a separate entity overcomes the identity of ordinary matter."

However, The gift of filling teeth as George and his daughter had, is no greater than the technology that the Gifts humans have received from the spiritual realm of the Great Creator; in the medical professions and communication.  A great many lives have been save by the gift of the medical professions.  The Gift of Understanding Knowledge is far more practical and beneficial to Humanity Than Georges' Gift of filling teeth.  In fact George was very upset with people trying to use him as a Dentist; Coming to his house asking to have their tooth filled.

"YpJPrDjUAtk","Dark matter and Dark energy explained!","@MrConstitutionDay","The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be."

"YpJPrDjUAtk","Dark matter and Dark energy explained!","@michaelkahn8744","Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy  Einstein‚Äôs theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.  However, we also observe gravitational effects ‚Äì curvature of spacetime ‚Äì in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.  An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed ‚Äì it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.  So, the question is now ‚Äì why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?  The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system ‚Äì 3 angular coordinates, œÜ1,  œÜ2,  œÜ3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.  The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubble‚Äôs surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local ‚Äúmountains‚Äù and ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù.  ‚ÄúValleys‚Äù in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù is really ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies ‚Äì regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, ‚Äúmountains‚Äù in spacetime will repel matter away, an ‚Äúanti-gravitational‚Äù effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.  Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The ‚Äúmissing‚Äù energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.  As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the ‚Äúcircumference‚Äù of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2œÄ light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:  Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6  km‚ÅÑs)/(2œÄ*4233Mpc)=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6  km‚ÅÑs)/26598Mpc=70.82(km‚ÅÑs)/Mpc  The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted. ‚Äì Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy"

"YpJPrDjUAtk","Dark matter and Dark energy explained!","@jayb5596","All quarks are literally connected through time regardless of the distance between them in space. They are all connected through the gluon field.   Look up node edging, weighted and unwieghted and once you grasp the function, apply edge weight to the gluon strings connecting the quarks. All the energy popping in and out of existence inside the nuclei of the proton is the gluon field applying the wieghted measure.   When we are in free fall in a gravitational field we are in a state of unweighted measure. This just means instead of the gluon field giving weight to your mass it's forcing you to rest in the field. When you are at rest in the field its applying your weight.    This is why when you go to the moon your body weight will change to reflect the strength of the gravitational field you come to rest in.  There is nothing at all about the geometry of a sphere that would change my body weight nothing at all. Unless that sphere was so small it was smashing me down with force.   Go back to the instant of the big bang the very moment time itself began, realize the gluons and quarks were a single field at a single point in spacetime. No matter how much spacetime you place between them the fields still one.  A way to view quantum gravity through the eye of some guy."

"cQyoYzHxdvo","The Dark Energy Mystery [4K]","@MrConstitutionDay","Dark matter is a multidimensional problem. It takes the topology of hyperdimensional math, and the discovery of same in the primordial universe, to understand it. The Chrysanthemum model does explain the reason why 3 dimensional matter in so stable, while higher and higher dimensional matter exhibits such immediate decay. The math is hard to deny. Postdoc string theorists should take a pill. You should get on board while the getting is still good.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

It‚Äôs the space that‚Äôs expanding. Andromeda continue to move toward us, that type of movement is subject to gravity. But space itself never was. Why would anyone expect gravity to affect something (like the expansion of space itself) if space can move faster than light. Aren‚Äôt scientists commingling the laws of physics that affect objects and energy, with space, which has already demonstrated that it isn‚Äôt subject to these laws. Otherwise, how could it expand faster than light? Yes, I understand that objects bend space, which causes others objects to move in those curves. But that‚Äôs no different than blowing up a balloon while pressing against different parts of the outside. An ant on the part you‚Äôre pressing would be moved into the depression, but nothing is stopping the balloon from expanding.

"cQyoYzHxdvo","The Dark Energy Mystery [4K]","@waynesloane8447","That the universe (U) has been found to be expanding more so over time, doesn‚Äôt lead me to jump to the conclusion that there must be a negative force that opposes Gravity (G).  As the U expands, the ability of  the matter in the so-called cosmic web (CW) to attract other matter is decreased. This is because the density of matter within the CW is decreasing - especially at the periphery of the observable U .    In other words, because the affect of G is weaker the more distant matter is from the source of, or approximate centre of, the expansion. The matter on the periphery of the known U experiences less G than matter closer to large concentrations of matter like the Great Attractor.   There is less G holding the peripheral matter back, and so it accelerates away with the momentum of the expansion.  No need for additional forces or anti-forces.   That said, in addition to the above explanation, if there is less density in the U beyond that which we can see, it may be that there is density or equilibrium gradient. The matter in the U may be irresistibly drawn to the lessor density on or beyond the observable periphery."

The concept of being far enough away from the planet we could ignore gravity would most likely never occur to us. Maybe something similar to that is affecting how we interpret what we see through our telescopes is at play?   Question for anyone : Why is the speed of light called a constant when, according to Einstein's famous E = mC^2, that is, (E/m)^1/2 = C, which says the speed of light is a ratio of the total energy of the universe divided by the total mass (the square root, but we're talking about such big quantities , for simplicity's sake, I'm just going to concentrate on the ratio part.   We have learned energy and matter are two versions of the same thing, nuclear bombs are an example of matter turning into energy.   If E = 0 and it's all one hunk of matter, C = 0 because there's no place to go.   If m approaches 0, and it's all energy, C will increase, in fact, C will approach infinity. Question: If the ratio changes, will all light waves/photons change speed or will ones released during a different epoch ""remember"" it's earlier speed?   Or will they simply adjust to their new reality, and analogue style smoothly change with the changing ratio.   Can the ratio E/m change? It does so within stars and atomic bombs, so why not the universe as a whole?      Similar to how a Gaussian closed 3-D surface can be treated as if its center of mass point contained all of its mass, can an area of space be treated as if its average E/m ratio were the universe‚Äôs E/m ratio? In other words, if in interplanetary space, can a space station behave as if the mass of the universe were much less than it is, thus raising the speed of light on the station?"

I like to take a shot at being the peasant who sparks a good idea for someone who actually knows things:  Is there a kind of pressure to space? I dont mean gas pressure outside the space station, I mean the space-part of spacetime. Does space inherently expand? And does gravity somehow alleviate this pressure? Because, if sources of gravity are spreading out because of space expansion, there is less sources of alleviating the pressure, which would accelerate the expansion.  I all likelihood I am wrong at multiple turns here, since I dont have any formal education and spacetime-math is 100% beyond me. But its fascinating noetheless.. can someone enlighten me?"

"U5AaG_OIxPo","Plot Twist: There‚Äôs No Dark Matter. Our Theory of Gravity is Broken","@MrConstitutionDay","It is the most absurd and fraudulent assumption that an alternative solution for gravity has replaced the theories of dark matter. If you read on a bit you'll come to understand that there are sensible theories of dark matter available to you.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.  part 2 Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models. It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models. In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks. In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter. We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation.  I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks. Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation. So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range.  The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us.  Relax. It's cool. I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter.  Thank you for reading.    part 3  Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks.  Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up. In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass. That is really close to the neutron star category of matter. While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are. The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number  times the mass of standard  model quarks.  This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe. It's not just a black hole. It's the end. Sorry - not sorry."

"U5AaG_OIxPo","Plot Twist: There‚Äôs No Dark Matter. Our Theory of Gravity is Broken","@roberttsou474","My own theory of VOID, Relativity and Dark Matter  1.	Empty space/vacuum/void is not really empty.  a.	The universe first started the two basic elements: matter and void. Humans belong to the world of matter and its equipment is also made from matter. This limits mankind‚Äôs ability to successfully measure the parameters of the VOID as of today. Could not measure it does not mean the void itself is really empty. It is like electrons and protons. The ‚ÄúMatters‚Äù and the ‚ÄúVOID‚Äù are the opposite of one another, and they interact with each other.  b.	The relativity theory helps us understand matter causes the space to curve. Another way to say this is it is an interaction in between the matter and the void. The relativity couldn‚Äôt say why matter causes that space to curve, but it was proven by observations that there is interaction in between space and matter. If VOID is not really void and interacts with matter then it makes sense why gravity can affect something millions miles away. It seems to me rather saying it is a curvature of space I would rather say it is an interaction in between the void and the matter.  c.	I think when Matter and Void are close to each other then it weakens the space/VOID. This is because they are opposite entities. For example, the earth and the sun, when you put two large matters in that space it weakens the space in between. The space starts to shrink in between. This is similar to the interaction you have with electrons and protons. When you have more electrons than protons it weakens the overall positive charge. You put sun and earth there then it weakens the space in between and it starts to shrink. I have doubts about calling it as a curvature. It is more like a space shrinking effect.  2.	Dark Matter and Dark Energy are also can be explained by VOID. Void itself is the actual Dark Matter and Energy. We swim inside it every day without knowing it.  a.	Maybe we have thought about the Dark Matter/Energy in a wrong direction. They do exist but they are maybe not the matters and energies we known of. We are in a matter world ourselves and we think like a person in a matter world. All our equipment is also made from matters and that makes things even more complicated and make detection of Dark Matter almost impossible because it has something to do with the VOID.  b.	The galaxy spins faster in the outer layer. Scientists could not figure out why it against the newton‚Äôs gravity theory. The Dark matter theory then created to explain that, and it was able to explain the phenomenon perfectly, but the problem is no one can detect those things in the real world. At least so far have not been able to. This makes me think we are looking at the wrong places.  c.	We may be looked at the wrong direction. The Dark Matter is not hidden inside the Galaxy but it is majorly outside the galaxy and push the galaxy from outside inward. The galaxy is floating in a mass of emptiness/VOID and all that emptiness has a very strong force coming from the void and they push the galaxy inward. Because there was so much emptier space/VOID in between galaxies compare to inside galaxies then it makes sense the outer galaxy stars have to move faster to compensate the force coming from the outside of the galaxy. So maybe we are looking at the Dark Matter in a wrong way. It is coming from the huge void in between all the galaxies, not inside the galaxy, and it is the opposite force of the Dark Matter we known of that actually generated all those extra gravity from outside the galaxy. It is the VOID that does all the job.  3.	Universe expansion now makes sense.  a.	We know the universe is expanding but we all scratch our heads about what actually causes the expansion and why it is expanding. If you believe what I said in no.1 and no.2 have some meaning, then it is very easy to explain why the universe is expanding. Because the VOID is pushing everything around it to every direction no matter where you are.  b.	My puzzle now is the VOID and the matter should be equal at the beginning of the universe due to the opposite properties but now it seems the VOID is winning due to the universe expanding. The more it expands then there is less chance the ‚Äúmatters‚Äù can catch up with the space expansion to reverse the cycle. The universe should be VOID and matter balanced so this is what I still couldn‚Äôt figure out why.  4.	Singularity now makes sense.  a.	Black holes now make sense. The black hole is full of matters and very small VOID there. There is not enough VOID inside to push it to expand so it will reach singularity.  b.	The whole universe will eventually become huge empty spaces/VOID and lots of singularities in few places if the universe expansion continues. I do not know if all those singularities will explode toward the end or not but I do not think they will combine into a single super-size singularity due to the universe‚Äôs expansion property. I also think the universe‚Äôs expansion will not stop because the more it expands the VOID gains more upper hand there and ‚Äúmatter‚Äù world will lose."

"hlhTHEcS8D0","Is Dark Matter Actually Real?","@michaelkahn8744","We've spent almost a century to find Dark Matter and Dark Energy but still there's no sign of them. May be it is time to find an Alternative Way to Explain Dark Matter and Dark Energy.  4-D Hypershere model of Universe can easily explain Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Void and even the reason why the measurement values of Expansion Rate are around 70 km/sec-Mpc   Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Void and Antigravity, ... all these are same phenomena. They just look different.  The problem of modern physics is they're trying to explain everything with particle physics and the physics is being cornered more and more to the dead end. To escape the dead end, they invent or design another imaginary particle in vain instead of trying to revise their way to approach to the problem.    I agree to the idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.  But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.  That's because gravity is not a force.  Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Antigravity, Void... all these are  just  joint effects of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.  Details are given below.    Einstein‚Äôs theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass.   This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.  Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.  However, we also observe gravitational effects ‚Äì curvature of spacetime ‚Äì in areas without any detectable mass.  This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.  So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.    An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed ‚Äì it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.  In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.    So, the question is now ‚Äì why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?  The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.  Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.  Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system ‚Äì 3 angular coordinates, œÜ1, œÜ2, œÜ3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.  We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.  Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.  The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.    The expansion rate at one point on the bubble‚Äôs surface may differ slightly from another point near it.  The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.  The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local ‚Äúmountains‚Äù and ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù on the surface of the universe bubble.  The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù. ‚ÄúValleys‚Äù in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.  So ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù is really ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.  These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies ‚Äì regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.  Conversely, ‚Äúmountains‚Äù in spacetime will repel matter away, an ‚Äúanti-gravitational‚Äù effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.  Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.  These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.  This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.  It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.  The ‚Äúmissing‚Äù energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.  The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.    Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.  As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.  Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.  Therefore, the ‚Äúcircumference‚Äù of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2œÄ light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.  This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.    At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).    Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:     Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/(2œÄ*4233Mpc)=(1.88*„Äñ10„Äó^6 km‚ÅÑs)/26598Mpc=70.82(km‚ÅÑs)/Mpc    The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.  There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.  ‚Äì Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy"
"hlhTHEcS8D0","Is Dark Matter Actually Real?","@MrConstitutionDay","Yes It's a bit difficult to understand. Tough for young scientists.  The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be."

The energy of the electric field is stored in a weak acceleration field, 8.61 cm/sec^2 for 1000000 volts/1mm but due to charge gravity, it is lower, 4.305cm/sec^2. The outcome is a surprise, charge itself generates gravity and anti-gravity, (-,+)5.802135 *10^9 Kg/Coulomb. Charge is coupled with a non geodesic bivector but the divergence of the energy momentum tensor does vanish. This cannot be used in a high voltage capacitor to generate a Hermann Bondi inertial dipole due to the dielectric layer's anti-alignment of induced dipoles. There must be a solution, however, that will reach a breakthrough propulsion technology. Positively charged gas and dust can account for part of the Dark Matter effect and intergalactic electrons can account for part of the Dark Energy effect. Please see ""Electro-gravity via geometric chronon field and on the origin of mass"" in ResearchGate. It is far more correct than the peer reviewed paper."

"hlhTHEcS8D0","Is Dark Matter Actually Real?","@Human_01","ORIGIN-OF-ENERGY [UNIVERSE/DIMENSION]    As Einstein proposed: ""energy is neither created nor destroyed.""     Energy is the basis of the perceivable universe. Energy exists in countless variations/forms. The qualities of the expanse of energy, as well as the intrinsic properties of it's physical form/outer layer is what dictates a 'type' of energy.     In quantum mechanics, energy can be observed and scaled in terms of size. They range from the universal to the subatomic/quantum. The smallest of which includes dark matter and dark energy. These are some of the simplest forms of energy/""life"" (conceptual context; energy is core of motion/life. Life is the complex 'regulated-energy-system' that hints at ""intelligent-design""). The correlation between the regulation[system] of energy in a given space or object, and the 'extent'/quantifiable-unit (like Gigabyte or 'storage-unit' of measurement) of the perceivable intelligent-design/consciousness is absolute (i.e. they are undoubtedly related. A kind of Efficiency measuring unit can be created quantify ""life""/extent of ""intelligent-design""). Intelligent-design is life in every context (it hints at it), e.g. even the layered structure of the sun, all the way to cells in the body, and placement of gravitational body's in our solarsytem how's varying levels of regulated-energy-system (courtesy of ""intelligent design""; a conscious-force that regulates and designed our conscious-universe).    Since energy cannot be created nor destroyed, and since it can be converted/transformed into various forms, and physically built up or built down(alter properties, e.g. frequency & vibration), then how did energy come into being in the first place? How did it come to occupy the space[medium] that we call the ""universe?"" The answer: is that energy is released from another dimension[dark-matter: filter/layer consisting fabric of reality] and into the dimension we reside in‚Äîmuch like a pocket that is connected/lined to the outside world. A ""whitehole"" would be example of such an existence.    Diffusion affects dark energy. The dimension pocket it came/leaked from is of a place with a high concentration (of dark energy). That would explain the [similar] moment / behavior that it shares with regular [atomic] particles, e.g. it's tendency to spread, and in a spherical/radiating manner, which indicates it originated from a small point in space. And in the case with diffusion between space of highly different concentration, the initial ""exchange"" is quite ""explosive""; providing high volumes of kinetic energy. The rate of exchange will remain constant depending on the difference/intensity/concentration of dark energy between two spaces. If the rate of dark energy radiation begins to slow down that would imply that the difference in concentration / concentration gradient between two dimensions is reaching equilibrium. In our universe, this would result in the expanse of space so large that atoms wouldn't be able to collide anymore.      Dark energy would still be leaking into the universe but it would be at a much slower rate, so the literal ""creation process"" would increasingly slow down, e.g. the rate of the birth of a new star would slow down. The result would be a very dull and spacious environment that remains seemingly forever frozen in time. Until one of the concentrated dimensions made contact with a [new] less concentrated one. The greater the difference in concentration between the two the more violent/energetic the explosion of their impact/contact with each other will be, e.g. a more powerful Big Bang.     Since dark energy is the building blocks of reality, and since it takes up space by radiating within it, and then contracts and compresses to become a denser form of energy, i.e. dark matter. And eventually becomes a denser form of energy in the form of atoms, and eventually stars, galaxies, and universes...there is a possibility of universes overcrowding (universes are known to attract to each other and merge).     In such an occasion, were a dimension is pulsing with too many universes (a outerverse-scaled big crunch, i.e. too much material in small space), contraction would occur again (possibly due to increase in gravity), resulting in the compression of denser forms of energy (resembling a red giant), that would then go on to emit and radiate into smaller forms of energy.  These would, again, eventually become dark energy, and it would eventually leak into an other dimension... Repeating the process all over again.    In short, it's a loop. The ""compress, expand, and emit"" process (similarly to a blackholes) seems to be infinite. But the question is what is it that continuously gives said energy direction. Diffusion is one explanation that partly answers this. But why doesn't the dimensions eventually reach equilibrium; to become a space of perpetual stagnation???     The answers seems to be that it can't reach equilibrium. ‚Äîbecause the dimensions keep pulsating (shrinking and expanding) at different rates in relation to each other. When they make contact, like a bubble, a sudden release of dark energy, driven by momentum (caused by diffusion) is made, and it is in the form of an explosion, i.e. the ""big bang."" Neither dimensions is broken or vanishes. Instead the dimension with a smaller concentration gradient is absorbed into the dimension with a larger gradient. The process happens very slowly, i.e. spanning an near-infinite duration of time. But if you looked at the bigger picture by speeding up time, it would likely resemble a ""bubble"" or ""photon"" bursting < i.e. a sudden by relatively less intense transfer of energy>. Except, like the photon or bubble it didn't bursting into nothingness. Instead, it was only transferred into another environment/dimension.    A whitehole would be a ""big bang"" but on a smaller scale. To reiterate, the point of contact between two [bubble] dimensions is comparable to two portals colliding/making contact with each other. When this occurs, the contents of the dimension with a higher concentration gradient, spills out into the dimension with a lower concentration gradient (rate of diffusion). In our dimension, such an occasion will resemble the big bang or a white hole, i.e. a bright burst of energy, that provides much needed momentum to a stagnating dimension-space, creating new and bigger constructs in the form of universes. The difference in concentration gradient is what decides the size of the explosion, i.e. whether it's a big bang or white hole (small blast)."

"hlhTHEcS8D0","Is Dark Matter Actually Real?","@bpdmf2798","Dark matter is a result of gravity being understood backwards. Gravity isn't caused by mass creating a gravitational field, it is instead caused be the exact opposite, a lack of mass creates and outward force. The lack of mass pushes mass together. That's also why galaxies are hard to describe with our understanding of gravity, the lack of mass in-between galaxies pushes on them keeping them spiral which has caused us to hypothesize dark matter because the galaxies don't have the mass to work the west they do, but we don't look at the empty space outside the galaxy pushing on it. It also explains dark energy, the expansion of space and why galaxies are moving apart. The force of anti gravity from areas without mass in space is so strong far away from galaxies that it creates new space to relieve the stress of that much empty space."

It‚Äôs the observations that are real and it‚Äôs gravity that is not being understood. We don‚Äôt need another law of gravity. Gravity is constant locally the same as the earth is flat locally. On a larger scale gravity is not constant and the earth is not flat. Gravity drops off considerably outside of the galaxy which changes considerably the measures of time and and distance which together make everything to appear to move faster including light. Things appear to be moving faster because they are moving faster as seen by us in our slower rate of time and our shorter measure of distance. This eliminates entirely the need for dark matter.    The changes in time and distance compound the changes in the speed of light. Do a thought experiment. Hold your hands a foot apart representing 186,000 miles saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù representing one second while pretending to see an imaginary photon going from one hand to the other. Now expand the distance saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù as fast as you can. You should notice that the speed of the imaginary photon increases the more distance expands and the more time speeds up the same as it does the farther away from the center of the galaxy it is.    The energy source of the vacuum energy is all of the supermassive black holes that are growing by drawing in spacetime. This means that the universe is not expanding into oblivion for no reason. It means there is no need for imaginary inflatons. Redshift occurs when light leaves the gravity of a galaxy and then the light is blue shifted when it enters another galaxy. Obviously galaxies aren‚Äôt all equal that way and distant galaxies are much more redshifted because of all of the mass of the surrounding galaxies that distance light has to pass by."
