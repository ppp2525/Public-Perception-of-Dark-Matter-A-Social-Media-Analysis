7260951406864125211,"Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. Dark matter is called ""dark"" because it does not appear to interact with the electromagnetic field, which means it does not absorb, reflect, or emit electromagnetic radiation and is, therefore, difficult to detect. Various astrophysical observations – including gravitational effects which cannot be explained by currently accepted theories of gravity unless more matter is present than can be seen – imply dark matter's presence.
