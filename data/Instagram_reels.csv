higgs_boson666,2023-11-19 17:12:36,@tristis_mercurii great  sorry  for my Dum question  I am  16 year old kid,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvFRyO7gA-1/?igsh=MWo0YzlsOXgwMGs0Nw==
mercuriimors,2023-11-19 14:26:16,"@higgs_boson666 yes, but not completely necessary. Gravity is a powerful form of energy, but to move through time you can use gravity but really all you need is energy. Light is energy too and sound for example there are more complex forms of energy that I am in no way an expert on, but if we could find the right type of energy particles we could possibly explore time and dark matter further. Or maybe we could create a gravity engine and use that to conquer time? :)",https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvFRyO7gA-1/?igsh=MWo0YzlsOXgwMGs0Nw==

mercuriimors,2023-11-19 04:04:50,"@higgs_boson666 I would like to think dark matter is in the faster time field relative to us because if it does not absorb or reflect light then it could be because it is outside of the effects of light particles, and anything beyond the speed or effect of light is usually because it is outside of what we perceive as time itself. Which is why I think we cant observe dark matter. :)",https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvFRyO7gA-1/?igsh=MWo0YzlsOXgwMGs0Nw==
mercuriimors,2023-11-19 03:56:59,"@higgs_boson666 Ill do my best, do you understand the theory of relativity? If so think of it as an extension of relativity, the dark matter is there because we can understand that its energetic effects are there, but we cannot observe it because it is beyond our relative perspective if that makes sense. Therefore we are in a slower or faster time field than dark matter. Just as we cannot physically see the past or future we cannot see dark matter but understand it is there.",https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvFRyO7gA-1/?igsh=MWo0YzlsOXgwMGs0Nw==

That doesn't make them not real. Case in point, the Highs Boson. We knew for a long time that it should exist. The physics was very confident. But even up until it was discovered there were some that argued other options were more likely. The same goes for dark matter. There are individuals that argue that a modification to general relativity should be made but even those options still require something like dark matter.  It's completely possible that we may discover something that will fundamentally alter what we believe, as is the way the scientific process works.

freddierhodes789,2023-05-27 00:04:48,"@ccfailed Well, you're sort of right. That then raises the question of why we don't detect any of these black holes. For instance, since they make up 5x the mass of the universe compared to regular matter, we should see things like black hole mergers, large (think neutron star) object falling in and stuff like that, all of which give out loads of radiation. The only way we wouldn't detect them is if they are numerous and small, which is the idea behind primordial black holes. These resolve some of the issues around gravitational lensing and the like, but the fact that we can neither detect their existence or their deaths through hawking radiation places hard upper and lower boundaries on their sizes. So still plenty of mystery!",https://www.instagram.com/p/Csq_mmfNEI_

Iâm not saying weâre not amazingly close (hopefully) but if you physically  have engineered something, you know things are missed, and thatâs here in reach of our hands. We also know to a degree that our own brains ð§  make up stuff when collecting data.  Again and again and again I sayâ¦. What an amazing place. I like the fact that the universe works in and with a set of laws and it doesnât matter who you are , size matters.

forgeardchris,2023-05-25 18:47:38,"Dark matter doesnât interact with normal matter as itâs higher dimensional matter, ie in more than 3 spacial dimensions.

Gravity is also higher dimensional, or itâs true nature exists in higher dimensions and what we feel is a shadow of that higher dimension, itâs why gravity is so weak and dark matter can have mass and a gravitational force associated with it.

In summary;
Dark matter is a higher dimensional matter, so does not interact.

All has the property mass, gravity is associated with mass, so dark matter can exert forces on our 3 space matter.

Gravity is not confined to our 3 spacial dimensions, it âleaksâ into this world, we experience the âshadowâ of it.

In a sense when we see a foam on largest scales, where the stars and galaxies typically form along these âhighwaysâ ð of which is a âshadowâ of this higher dimensional space.

And it pervades all, from large scale to small scale in the form of a foam.
It is a clueâ¦ ð 

Gravity, much like light, produces physical limits of this universeâ¦ ð

rishabh.mangal.bansal,2023-01-08 12:41:03,"According to Vadic Rashmi Theory, universe isn't expanding and light loses energy while traveling through space so dark energy doesn't exist. The photon is made of praan rashmi which dissipate into space while living is traveling through it. Dark Matter is Akash tatva which is the charge less state of matter. Space is manas tatva, which is a flexible chargeless sheet like state of matter which is bended by objects and that's how objects generate gravity.",https://www.instagram.com/p/CnJ0ljVJUPX
