"1bhonms","Study: Dark matter does not exist and the universe is 27 billion years old","kvfscpb","martja10",">Tired light is a class of hypothetical redshift mechanisms that was proposed as an alternative explanation for the redshift-distance relationship. These models have been proposed as alternatives to the models that involve the expansion of the universe. The concept was first proposed in 1929 by Fritz Zwicky, who suggested that if photons lost energy over time through collisions with other particles in a regular way, the more distant objects would appear redder than more nearby ones.   >   >**Zwicky acknowledged that any sort of scattering of light would blur the images of distant objects more than what is seen. Additionally, the surface brightness of galaxies evolving with time, time dilation of cosmological sources, and a thermal spectrum of the cosmic microwave background have been observed—these effects should not be present if the cosmological redshift was due to any tired light scattering mechanism.**\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] Despite periodic re-examination of the concept, **tired light has not been supported by observational tests** and remains a fringe topic in astrophysics.\[4\]  &#x200B;  [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_light)"

Primary mechanism for observation seems to be that light *does* lose information over extremely long distances, where previously it was assumed it did not.

"1bhonms","Study: Dark matter does not exist and the universe is 27 billion years old","kvjf2hb","Heerrnn","One of the most basic ideas in science is that if there is a simpler explanation for something, that is likely correct.    - The universe is 27 billion years old    - The universe is 13 billion years old and there is this undetectable *stuff* that has gravity which made things pull together much faster in the early universe, but it doesn't interact with normal matter and is electromagnetically neutral and doesn't interact with light so we are having trouble detecting it..... etc.    The first one is simpler than the second. If we can explain it this simply, then it is the right thing to do.    One problem I think of is, then what is preventing the stars in our galaxy from being flung out and our galaxy flying apart? Don't we know that galaxies rotate faster than should be possible given the gravity from the visible matter? "

"1bhonms","Study: Dark matter does not exist and the universe is 27 billion years old","kvhinr1","Farts_McGee","Even if there are black holes at the center of galaxies that still isn't nearly enough mass to keep clusters from puking their galaxies and stars all over the place. The tricky thing about gravity is that it falls off over distance very quickly.  Even super massive black holes aren't even close to enough pull to stabilize a single galaxy, let alone a cluster.     We need x amount of mass to keep these features together by means of gravity, but none of the observed features have enough mass to accomplish it,  thus we have dark matter as the explanation.  It's x - observed mass = dark matter.    The article at hand functionally asked ""what do we need to change for dark matter to not be the answer?"" Their response is: ""a previously unobserved feature of light is invoked to explain that things are waaaaay older than we thought and 26B is what just so happens to work."" "
"1bhonms","Study: Dark matter does not exist and the universe is 27 billion years old","kviq9nk","follow_your_leader","For that to work, the black holes would need to be several orders of magnitude more massive, and if there were objects that massive, they would be detected immediately because they'd be emitting jets of gamma rays across the universe, and the stars in the centers of these galaxies would be spinning around them rapidly enough that it would be unmistakeable that was where all theass is.  That doesn't fit observation.  Galaxies have black holes near their centers, that's consistent with how we understand they formed after the big bang, but those black holes are not the galactic nucleus around which the galaxy orbits, they're just one very dense object surrounded by billions of stars that dwarf it's mass several million times over.    Galaxies orbit themselves, with the stars gravitationally interacting with millions of others in their vicinity, as the masses of stars orbit about the galaxy's collective center of mass due to the angular momentum of the cloud of hydrogen and helium they originally formed from.  Dark matter doesn't appear to be concentrated in the centers of galaxies any more significantly than stars are; it also appears to be present in the halos of galaxies, which extends several times larger than the disk of spiral galaxies, or the visible edges of elliptical or irregular ones.  Supermassive black holes and other compact halo objects (smaller black holes or neutron stars in the halos of galaxies) have all been ruled out as dark matter candidates because the amount of mass in some observed galaxies actually ends up being several times greater than the visible matter, and it doesn't like up with observation for there to be so much dense, invisible objects that they outweigh entire galaxies, especially since these objects would also have local effects that could be observed.  There are candidates for dark matter, but black holes have already been ruled out."

The paper starts on the basis that it wants to try and make the age of the universe older than the accepted number. It then goes ""what is a way of doing that?

Where JWST comes in is with the desire for an older age of the universe, but this isn't necessarily correct because the angular size of cosmic dawn galaxies discrepancy can be fixed by several other routes, and no astronomer (the author is not an astronomer) worth their salt believes that this discrepancy is actually evidence of a significant difference in the age of the universe."

Dark matter is the mysterious substance that makes up about 25% of the universe.","js54kgn","rememberurtowel","We are looking for particles, but only seeing gravity.    In some circles of string theory it is supposed that some strings are attached to the fabric of spacetime in their respective universes, like a string with both ends glued to a table top, the table top being the universe. While other strings are closed loops, like elastic bands. These closed loop strings could have the ability to travel into neighbouring universes if a ""multiverse"" exists. If the string(s) that are responsible for gravitational attraction are closed loops then gravitational influence could extend beyond our universe to effect other universes, which would also mean that gravtiatonal forces from massive objects in other universe would also effect our universe. Dark matter (or extra gravity) could just be the gravitational influence from massive objects, like galaxies, in neighbouring universes. Like ink bleeding through pages of a book.    I feel the relative weakness of gravity as a force is evidence of this as we are only measuring the force of the gravity acting in our universe. Gravity may be deemed to be closer in magnitude to the other fundemnetal forces of the universe if we could measure its effects multidimensionally.    This would also really make sense for the situation where the galaxy clusters collided leaving the gass in the middle, but having the dark matter keep moving as though the collision had little effect on it. If the influencing objects were also located in seperate universes there would have been no physical collision between them."

Dark matter is the mysterious substance that makes up about 25% of the universe.","js8q9ul","rememberurtowel","Let's propose that there are two universes that have point correspondence(one point is one universe corresponds to one point in the other universe). A mass at a point in one universe will create a gravitational attraction at the corresponding point in the other universe.   If in one universe there was a large mass at a point it would cause a gravitational pull at the corresponding point in the other universe. This would result in mass accumulating at this point in the both universes. The slow condensing of matter in one universe would have been influenced by and have influenced the slow condensing of matter in the other universe. This would result in universes with similar mass distribution. Galaxies would probably overlap, but the individual stars in the galaxies would probably not overlap.  This would be in line with what we have observed. No dark matter on the solar scale, but dark matter on the galactic scale.  On the galactic scale I don't think you would see galaxies being ripped apart by nothing because galaxies would overlap with that counterparts in the other universe. There may be Rogue Dark Matter Galaxies floating around that have been separated from their counterparts. The question would be how common are they.  Let's say that the galaxies overlap, due to their incredible masses, but the stars within the galaxies do not overlap. The Dark Matter Stars from one galaxy would be unlikely to interact with stars in the other universe due to the immense distances between stars in a galaxy. Maybe these interactions would be more common close to the galactic centre. Even when two galaxies collide it is extremely unlikely that two individual stars will collide.  It could be possible that a massive star in one universe could leak enough gravity into the other universe to cause gases to gather at a point in the other universe. This could be the phenomena that the article describes.  I think looking for phenomena like you describe is the first step is supporting our refuting my theory. It would be interesting to determine the strength of gravity between universes and I think we could learn a lot about the geometry of our universe by analysing the distribution of mass in our universe."

He did it using 2 methods: one using the potential energy of constituent parts via Virial Theorem, and the other using light. The two results were hugely out of line, and this has absolutely nothing to do with rotations because this is on a different scale from individual galaxies.  James Webb telescope in its background radiation images observed patterns that correspond to there being a bunch of mass that didn't interact with photons early on in the universe's lifetime  We can observe galaxy cluster collisions, like the Bullet Cluster. We can see a bunch of shiny gas collisions in the middle, but gravitational lensing shows that most of the mass has actually just passed through each other and is not emitting any light  (The ""pass through"" part isn't too weird btw. Stars in a galaxy cluster collision, for example, also behave as if they effectively passed through each other, because the odds of one star actually directly hitting another one are basically 0)  That series of observations *is* dark matter  Or, in other words, the framing here isn't ""a bunch of our data doesn't line up with out models. Must be invisible untouchable matter, let's go with that""  It's ""hey a bunch of our data is reporting a ton of invisible untouchable non-luminous (dark) matter.

There is however reason to believe that local gravity varies as a function of the extended mass distribution around that point, I linked you two papers in our other thread with evidence of this."

The knowledge of the sun sets the baseline, without it, we could not understand anything about distant stars.

Anyway, this is an irrelevant tangent, because it says nothing about quarks, protons etc, which have all been measured experimentally, which DM has not been.   > If the constants weren't universal, we'd see those effects by looking in the skies.  Actually, it does not work like that. You have to assume that the constants are universal in order to apply these interpretations to the data. The data cannot and does not speak for itself.   > Galaxy and star formation would look different depending on what direction in the universe we looked  Why would that be the case? They do look different the further out and the larger scale you look at though. Galaxies appears much more compact and dense, dark matter appears that we cannot detect experimentally, galaxies get redshifted further out. Like, the literal measurements show strong difference; you assume some baseline, like the constants are universal, and then you can interpret those measurements as being intrinsic differences, or as being apparent differences. But you can apply no interpretation at all to that data without making those assumptions, at this point.  I'm not sure how people do not understand this here. Ask any cosmologist, and they will tell you that you do indeed have to assume that the laws of physics are universal in order to interpret any observations from the universe. The difference is, anything else we've observed has also been confirmed experimentally, usually prior ro observation, with some exceptions, except for DM and DE, which have never been detected experimentally."

I am by no means an expert in the field but its simple and it seems to be the solution to a lot of items pointed out in this list posted already  [https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6488wb/i\_dont\_want\_to\_be\_anti\_science\_but\_i\_am\_doubtful/dg05wx4/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6488wb/i_dont_want_to_be_anti_science_but_i_am_doubtful/dg05wx4/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)   I would love some experts to troubleshoot this an tell me I'm way out in left field but it seems to hit some other high notes too.  If one assumes an equal amount matter and antimatter was created at the big bang and the anti-matter had a negative gravitational force eventually the conventional matter would clump together to form galaxies and the dark matter would fill the void and cause further expansion. Some normal matter would probably get stuck out there and would be unable to strongly interact because the net repulsive force of all that dark matter in the void pushing everything away.  That gets at how and why the universe continues to expand and explains that missing mass.   I can start addressing the list linked above:  1) Objects traveling at escape velocities in a galaxy don't escape because there is the force of anti-gravity pushing them back in.   2) There is likely not just anti-matter particles in the void between galaxies but also in interstellar space accounting for the increased kinetic energy  3) Internal and external anti-gravitational forces would probably have an influence on the rate of rotation on the galaxy  4) The extra antimatter in interstellar and intergalactic space can account for the extra mass causing our gravitational lensing numbers to be off what we predicted.   5) Antimatter floating around in the gaps would explain the lack of mass that isn't made up for by burnt out stars  6) Haven't through through this one enough.  7) Only 4% of the mass you say? Well if everything was that close at the big bang you probably had a lot of anti-matter and matter crashing into each other destroying each other and creating energy. 4% of regular matter making it out of that environment is probably not a crazy number.  Gotta go.....to be continued on an edit if I can or if you guys tell me I'm nuts."

The motion, generated by breaking of the axion shift symmetry, significantly modifies the conventional computation of the axion dark matter abundance. Additionally, these dynamics allow axion dark matter to react more strongly with ordinary matter, exceeding the prediction of the conventional misalignment mechanism.  So this is an interesting assumption of they’re paper. They assigned a none zero velocity values to the early stage axioms in the universe creation.

Because space is so vast and we can see so far out, I'd think it's the particles all gathered together creating what scientists call dark matter. I base this purely because every piece of mass has gravity. This would definitely include the very thing that makes us say today is today and tomorrow is tomorrow. Also, I already believed in the idea of gravity existing as something we could feel and see. I told my friend, if Earth was to suddenly disappear, the gravity wouldn't just immediately disappear with it. It would linger for a bit. Lo and behold, 7 years later scientists discover gravitational waves. I also base my theory on the fact that astronauts and objects in space age slower than objects on Earth. Just like the astronaut twins comparison, i think the one in space (i know it sounds stupid) was falling and spinning across the Earth so fast, the space station and him collided/dodged the time particles in space thus literally giving him more time alive."

If they exist, they would solve one of the issues with the current ""Standard Model"" of particle physics...certain predictions of the theory don't match reality, but they _would_ match reality if axions existed.  Axions are also a good candidate for dark matter.  Predictions for their mass and how they interact with the other particles are similar to predictions for the mass and interactions dark matter would need to have in order to produce the results we observe.  And there could easily be a whole lot of them, just like there are zillions of neutrinos everywhere.  However, previous attempts to estimate the number of axions produced in the early universe produced too few axions interacting too weakly to account for the amount of dark matter we think exists.  This research comes up with a new idea about how the initial conditions of the universe could have lead to a lot more axions that interact more strongly....matching the effects we see today of dark matter.  Right now this is just theoretical, not experimental.  However it does make the case for axions = dark matter a bit stronger.  We'll need some actual experimental evidence to prove the case though."

A model of something can be fundamentally useful even if it's incorrect or incomplete. You use your mental model of how things work all the time and they're probably wrong to some degree. For example I don't know how cars work work very well but I have a simple model in my head of they work and it's good enough for me to use them, but not good enough for me to fix them.  Going back to physics, it's possible to have an incorrect or incomplete model of the universe that is still fundamentally useful. For example the theory of gravity was pretty darn useful even though it was incomplete, and the different theories of the atom were useful despite many of them being ultimately proven incorrect. If you look at the current subject matter, it's clear we have an incomplete model of the universe and yet we can still build all the amazing things we have!  When we're dealing with such complicated theoretical models it's good to work through them to see what the implications are. If you follow a model to it's logical conclusion and it generates something that's known to be incorrect then it's a good sign the model is wrong. On the other hand, if it you walk through all the parts of the model and it explains everything we already know to be true then it lends support to the model being correct.  So this paper - if I understand it correctly - makes a connection that hadn't been made before, which is helpful for building support for the model. A whole other bunch of people (experimental physicists?) are probably working on proving is disproving the theory in reality. Both are useful for different reasons."

That would make the electron of approximate magnitude 10⁶ and the axion of 10⁻⁵, which is 11 orders of magnitude smaller, so 10⁻¹¹. A ""millionth of a billionth"" would be 10⁻¹⁸ That would make the axion ""a hundred thousand million times"" lighter than the electron, which would make it 10⁷ (ten million) times heavier than what the scientists in your article even tested for.  One of the big things about this paper seems to be that while the mass they predict is miniscule in comparison to an electron, it would still be way way heavier than what it was previously believed to be and would *not* in fact be already ruled out, while simultaneously being a possible explanation for a third thing we can't explain.  Also, there was just recently another experiment with a xenon tank detector that gave low sigma results that could have been axions.  Edit: was off by one order of magitude because I can't math"

I'm at least 30% sure you're trolling, but in case you actually think you have it all figured out:  > 1) Objects traveling at escape velocities in a galaxy don't escape because there is the force of anti-gravity pushing them back in.   ""Anti-gravity"" would push matter out, not pull it in...  > 2) There is likely not just anti-matter particles in the void between galaxies but also in interstellar space accounting for the increased kinetic energy  If there were we would have seen it. Anti-matter is just as visible as regular matter, i.e. it interacts similarly with light.   > 3) Internal and external anti-gravitational forces would probably have an influence on the rate of rotation on the galaxy  > 4) The extra antimatter in interstellar and intergalactic space can account for the extra mass causing our gravitational lensing numbers to be off what we predicted.   > 5) Antimatter floating around in the gaps would explain the lack of mass that isn't made up for by burnt out stars  The beautiful thing about non-cranky physics is that one can actually do calculations to back up such statements. Vague hand-waving accompanied by ""it probably works out"" is unlikely to impress any non-cranks.   > 6) Haven't through through (sic) this one enough.  Evidently, this goes for every other point as well.  > 7) Only 4% of the mass you say? Well if everything was that close at the big bang you probably had a lot of anti-matter and matter crashing into each other destroying each other and creating energy. 4% of regular matter making it out of that environment is probably not a crazy number.  See points 3-5.  But all that is moot, because your theory is quite nonsensical to begin with, because antimatter does not have a ""negative gravitational force"". For all we know, it works just like ordinary matter as far as gravity is concerned. This is because antimatter particles have the same mass as their ordinary matter counterparts due to CPT symmetry, which is in turn due to Lorenz invariance which is perhaps the most well-tested fact in all of science."

Nobody was claiming gravitational waves were a false and shoddy attempt at a prediction even though we predicted and believed they existed for approx 100 years before seeing them, because they came about from an accurate and well-founded theory. The same is happening here with DM. Of course it doesn’t have to be axions, but the reason essentially all physicists assume DM is correct is not out of arrogance, it’s an informed opinion.   FYI we have “proven” plenty about constraints on what it can be, production mechanisms, etc. based on these observations.

We know how much things like stars and neutron stars and black holes weigh. We know how much gravity that should produce. Things aren't orbiting as if only that much gravity was in the mix.  We can even estimate how much a galaxy weighs... but if it weighs that much, then it shouldn't behave as we see it behave. There is alot more mass somewhere. Invisible. Nothing else could explain.

This constant is one of the most unreliable constants, as the method for measurement produces dramatically varying data/values, and is extremely sensitive to so many external factors. I think is it time we take a step back and at least try to understand the gravitational constant better before hypothesizing matter that only interacts with the gravitational force... which is odd considering a majority of mass is due to the high energy bonds between quarks, which is inevitably going to interact with the electromagnetic force, ultimately making it detectable."

So, antimatter's not the answer to our particular question.  But, there's also no guarantee that there's actually any missing matter at all; the article is fast to suggest the ""existence of dark matter has been confirmed by several independent observations,"" without ever listing any such detections - we've never seen dark matter *at all*, merely inferred its existence from the reaction to matter around it and the speed it's moving. This is particularly troublesome, as we've ran some rather sensitive experiments and scientists are starting to get pretty nervous about their experiments ever detecting anything - pretty bad news if you're asking for billions of tax dollars for your experiment; even if a negative finding is still good science, it's really bad politics.  [XENON](http://www.xenon1t.org/) is probably the biggest name in WIMP searches right now, and they've only recently published on detecting anything that could possibly even be dark matter... and even their scientists are yet to be convinced they detected anything and it wasn't just noise introduced into the system from the environment. What they have done though is squeeze out the possible energy regions it could still be hiding in to a huge degree, such that the next generation of the experiment should probably be able to reach a conclusion (one that would be highly sensitive to neutrino fluxes - the most 'dark' matter we currently know to exist).  MOND could also be an explanation that doesn't require bricking much of what we understand about the standard model, since gravity is rarely if ever discussed in particle physics. It's also why it's pretty tough to prove out; we don't have much of an idea on how to experimentally rule it out, given how much science already agrees with Einstein's interpretations.  And it's possible none of our explanations are right and we're going to need another one that's even weirder than anything we've seen so far."

Scientific realism about the current model is the doctrine that that it is literal, objective truth about the universe, and I see that, frankly, as being dogmatic scientism. Scientific Instrumentalism, on the other hand, would maintain that any scientific model - the current 'standard model' of physics included - is merely a subjective, human-centric account of our observations about a universe which was not, ultimately, built for us.  Now, bear in mind that almost every prediction, and postulation of science has ultimately been proven to be wrong, and that this principle of falsifiability is literally the bedrock upon which the scientific method is founded.  So, my speculation, and I have to say my *suspicion*, is that there might be at least one, or more, error(s) built into a 'standard model' which has now been elevated from a position of being just that: a model, a human explanation, *an* account of our experience of the universe which we happen to inhabit, to being *thee* gospel truth about our reality.   It seems as much as physicists search they've thus far been completely unable to find any direct evidence of dark matter. What they do of course offer in support of its existence is more and more what I would classify as 'circumstantial' evidence: data from the behaviour of ordinary visible matter, movement of the universe at a grand scale, that sort of thing, and now postulation of additional subatomic particles. But what's curious to me is that all of this is evidence which is *interior* to the the system which, as I've said, I'm suspicious might well have pre-existing errors built into it.   So, we're saying: the standard model only works if dark matter exists. Therefore dark matter exists. And then setting about trying to prove that it does indeed exist by offering evidence from within that same system we're trying to prop up. Because, after all, if it doesn't exist, the standard model doesn't work...   Really?  I think it's at least equally likely that there's something wrong with the standard model.   Just my two cents, but don't mention it over at r/physics or they'll ban you. A lot of research grants riding on this dark matter stuff..."

Just to expand on it a little bit in terms of your specific thoughts about physics working differently on a galactic level, that can be used to explain a lot of the evidence, especially the earlier stuff, in that comment. Specifically you fiddle around with gravity a bit and you can reproduce a lot of what we see. However the observation of the Bullet Cluster (point nine of the above comment) really tears those theories up because essentially what we see there is a divergence between where we observe the mass (through lensing) and where we observe the stuff which **heavily** implies an unseen particle.   All the physics-behaves-differently-on-large-scale ideas still have gravity coming from matter.

According to a new study, axion velocity provides a key insight into the dark matter puzzle.","fw94ppf","__fuck_all_of_you__","That is just dead wrong. There is ample evidence, like the observations of colliding galaxies that behave like they lost their dark matter. All alternative explanations and theories that try to explain phenomena we believe to be caused by dark matter, without fail, cannot also explain the other evidence we have and often have direct observable contradictions. Our black hole photograph further mutilated the long dead rotting corpses of modified gravity theories even further, matching general relativity perfectly in the highest gravity environments there are, after the observations of galaxies without apparent dark matter killed them dead.  If it isn't modified gravity causing all the gravitational lensing and weird galaxy spin, it HAS to be some kind of real mass. What that actually is isn't clear, but there very clearly IS some kind of invisible (hence dark) matter clumped around galaxies. Therefore, we have ample evidence for dark matter, but only weak and inconclusive evidence for what it actually is made of.   In fact, this is doubly wrong because our understanding of established physics does **NOT** predict dark matter. There is no ""here be dark matter"" term in the standard model. There is no reason there couldn't for example still be axions to explain away the strong force CP symmetry conservation, but with axions being rare and not having a particularly high share of the mass in the universe. There are certainly holes in the standard model that make it incomplete and, for example, unsolvable in situations that require general relativity and not just special relativity. But none of those holes tell us that there being five times as much invisible as visible matter, is more likely than any other scenario that could fill those holes. It is only when looking at direct observations of galaxies and their gravitational lensing strength that dark matter comes into the picture as necessary. It also isn't necessary to explain galaxy formation, but it sure is helpful. That is an area where it could theoretically be just our incomplete understanding, but where dark matter sure is improving things.  So no /u/PvtDeth, that is not correct, it's the exact opposite. Our established theories do not imply that there must be dark matter, but there are observations that almost certainly cannot be anything but unseen matter that is five times as abundant as visible matter. If you do not call that evidence, you're delving into semantics with which the vast majority of scientist will not agree with"

In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, the total mass–energy of the universe contains 5% ordinary matter and energy, 27% dark matter and 68% of a form of energy known as dark energy.[5][6][7][8] Thus, dark matter constitutes 85%[a] of total mass, while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95% of total mass–energy content.[9][10][11][12]  The ONLY reason dark matter is hypothesised to exist is because we have primary evidence for its existence. If we didn’t have so much evidence, we wouldn’t have come up with dark matter in the first place.   We don’t know exactly what dark matter IS. At the moment it is a catch all term to explain all these observations. It could be particles, it could be some behaviour of physics we haven’t understood yet. Claiming dark matter “may not exist” is absolutely wrong. It may not be a particle, but these observations exist, and they don’t go away when we’ve understood what causes them."

We have evidence of dark matter through its interaction with gravity and its non interaction (or absence of interaction) with other forces. Because of these interactions we can “detect” dark matter because of its gravitational affect on other mass. When we see gravitational forces concentrated in space but it appears that light is passing through it as if it is transparent than we have found a clump of dark matter. See the bullet cluster for a good example  The problem with dark matter is not proving that it exists, we can do that to somewhat acceptable standards already. The problem with dark matter is explaining why it behaves so differently from normal matter by only interacting with gravity and no other force. Here is where the sidewalk ends and the many competing theories start.   Ockham’s razor dictates that the leading theory must be that dark matter is a new undiscovered type or particle (like an axion or WIMP) as this theory requires the least amount of conjecture on top of what we know for sure.

Scientific Instrumentalism, on the other hand, would maintain that any scientific model - the current 'standard model' of physics included - is merely a subjective, human-centric account of our observations about a universe which was not, ultimately, built for us.  This is pretty accurate. Our models and theories are just that - models and theories. We come up with a explanation for some unknown (say, why do apples fall on Newton's head) that can be tested, and test it. The data then either supports or denies that theory. Note that any paper will only ever say ""data that is consistent with a discovery of X"" - we can never prove for sure that it *is* X, but that the data would be what is expected by the existence of X.  >Now, bear in mind that almost every prediction, and postulation of science has ultimately been proven to be wrong, and that this principle of falsifiability is literally the bedrock upon which the scientific method is founded.  Yep, by using iteration and building in existing work you can produce a theory that matches observations.  >So, my speculation, and I have to say my *suspicion*, is that there might be at least one, or more, error(s) built into a 'standard model' which has now been elevated from a position of being just that: a model, a human explanation, *an* account of our experience of the universe which we happen to inhabit, to being *thee* gospel truth about our reality.   No error is ""built-in"" - every theorist wants a theory that explains everything. There are problems in the SM though - no DM explanation, to get the observed higgs mass you need to add in a bunch of corrections that are carefully chosen rather than being well explained by logic, and no mechanism for neutrino masses, despite their existence, among others. Oh, and gravity doesn't really fit in too well.   >It seems as much as physicists search they've thus far been completely unable to find any direct evidence of dark matter. What they do of course offer in support of its existence is more and more what I would classify as 'circumstantial' evidence: data from the behaviour of ordinary visible matter, movement of the universe at a grand scale, that sort of thing, and now postulation of additional subatomic particles. But what's curious to me is that all of this is evidence which is *interior* to the the system which, as I've said, I'm suspicious might well have pre-existing errors built into it.   There's a common misunderstanding on the experimental nature of dark matter here. By looking at galaxies, there is a huge and varied body of evidence that they are much heavier that what matter can be directly observed. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Observational_evidence) has a nice write up of done of the evidence. All of these pieces of evidence are isolated from each other, and independently show the existence of unexplained mass. We know there's extra matter, but we can't find it by looking with telescopes. Hence the name: dark matter.  There's lots of suggestions about what could cause this, mostly either based around modifying the rules of gravity in different areas of space to make it stronger in galaxies, or by adding in some undetected, heavy particle. The modified gravity theories have largely been excluded by LIGO, and aren't seriously considered anymore.  To summarise: dark matter is absolutely real and detected - as real as gravity is. The trouble is we don't know *what* it is.   >So, we're saying: the standard model only works if dark matter exists. Therefore dark matter exists.   It's the other way round. We know from observation that dark matter exists. We don't know what it is. The standard model provides no explanation. In this area, the standard model is incomplete.  > And then setting about trying to prove that it does indeed exist by offering evidence from within that same system we're trying to prop up. Because, after all, if it doesn't exist, the standard model doesn't work...  > >Really? > >I think it's at least equally likely that there's something wrong with the standard model.   This is right. The standard model only works if dark matter *doesn't* exist, as it provides no explanation for it. The standard model is only the current working theory of particle physics. It does explain everything else pretty accurately, [with some predictions matching reality to more than one part in a billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_magnetic_dipole_moment).     >Just my two cents, but don't mention it over at r/physics or they'll ban you. A lot of research grants riding on this dark matter stuff...  We're not lining our pockets with grants. We're not well paid (as a PhD student I could more than double my income over night by walking out the door and into an industry job). We have to argue carefully to get our grant money, and it's carefully scrutinised by governments and the press to make sure we're spending it on physics.   We return a huge amount to society: the existence of CERN and the LHC has given us the world wide Web, proton therapy for cancer, cheap and fast computer storage, and much more. Other experiments have given us lasers, microwaves and more. None of these inventions were predicted, they just happened by necessity as we constructed and developed experiments. I once heard a figure like ""every pound invested in science returns at least £10 to the economy"".  This makes grant application writing very difficult, when we can't say what we'll return. My favourite (probably apocryphal) story to support this is as follows:  There was once a German physicist named Heinrich Hertz. He was interested in electromagnetism. He noticed that in some cases a spark in one experiment caused noise in another. He decreed ""This had no use whatsoever"", and threw it in his cupboard. He had just discovered the radio, an invention that would move us from the industrial to the modern era."

One major weak link in our current physics models is the gravitational constant, which is one of if not the most unreliable constants we use. It varies widely in measurements due to the extremely sensitive and centuries old technique used to measure it. Not to say this is THE problem, but I think we ought to try understanding the tools used before trying to produce a mysterious form of matter that we have been trying to find for decades to no avail...   Another compelling thought of dark matter is the root of it's intellectual conception. A molecule that only interacts with the gravitational force through its mass is interesting at face value, however the discrepancy there is that the mass of molecules is largely dictated by the very high energy subatomic bonds between the quarks. These high energy bonds produce a lot of entropy into the system which will ultimately lead to emissions in the electromagnetic spectrum, making it easily detectable. I find it hard to understand a form of matter which is able to have so much mass to affect the behavior of galaxies, without the very subatomic source of said mass interacting with the other fundamental forces of the universe.   It also produces a complication that this dark matter is only able to affect large bodies? Why is it that we are unable to see local phenomena which points to it's existance, when modeling smaller systems such as a solar system for example. This ties back into the gravitational constant issue - if a small variance in the constant is used for a few (relatively) small calculations, it won't be very apparent; however, if you use that constant for a large number of big calculations, like a galaxy, the discrepancy in the constant may be able to affect the outcome more apparently.   Just some late night thoughts and I may be wrong, but the dark matter hypothesis produces more questions than answers, much like string theory"

Absolutely, but no consensus about what it is, just that it exists.  > I'm out of the loop (and it's way too advanced for me anyway) but i was under the impression that it could still be explained with some sort of macro-scale astrophysical law we might not yet know about ?  I think you're referring to modified gravity. A lot of the early evidence was based on the gravitational interactions of galaxies, and stars in galaxies. Thus, some people suggested that maybe the theory of gravity was incorrect. I'm a particle physicist, not a cosmologist, but my understanding is that this has largely been disproved by LIGO, the gravitational wave observatory, which had shown that the rules of gravity are at least pretty similar throughout the universe.  As a result, the most likely explanation is some form of particle that is heavy, but doesn't interact with normal matter in any way other than gravity. There are many theoretical candidates for what this particle could be - perhaps several of them exist."

I'm glad tgat you agree at least that we should be careful of falling into dogmatism about scientific models.   The first thing I need to say is that the comment about research grants was made with tongue firmly in cheek. I was really just poking fun, and I suppose was smarting a little at having been banned from r/physics for challenging the status quo last week. I absolutely do not doubt either the integrity or legitimacy of the work done by physicists or scientists, or by any other academics for that matter.  However, I must take issue with the certitude with which you declare the existence of dark matter. You've really just restated the situation which I find so problematic.  >To summarise: dark matter is absolutely real and detected - as real as gravity is. The trouble is we don't know what it is.  It's interesting that you should choose gravity as an analogy for dark matter here, since just like in the case of dark matter, we actually *don't* have any direct evidence whatsoever for gravity's existence. All that we can do is look at the universe, empirically, and observe that there is a certain degree of regularity in the way that things occur: you drop something, it falls to the ground at a specific rate, massive objects *seem* to exert attractive  force upon one another and so on. And this *could* be explained by the action of a fundamental force acting on everything. But equally, what we call 'the force gravity' at our level of analysis might well be just the result of the way the universe *is* at the fundamental level. It need not be resultant from a force *acting* to cause an effect. 'Gravity' might equally well be merely a human *description* of a regularity which we observe in our surroundings.  And similarly with the claim that we know beyond doubt that dark matter exists. All that we can do is look at the way the observable universe behaves, and then speculate as to the reasons for that behaviour. We know that galaxies behave in such a way that would be well explained by the existence of matter which we can't see. Okay, that much is true, but that's not the same thing as *establishing* the existence of that invisible matter, surely? I'm just not comfortable with the logical leap from this idea, to the idea that that matter's existence is beyond any doubt. It seems just a little too ad hoc for my sceptical sensibilities. There's too much else we *don't* know about the universe to be so certain.  Of course, physics as it is now has to operate on the assumption that dark matter does exist. That's where we're at right now. But I strongly suspect that ultimately a more complete and unified physics will dispense with any need for it. You might call that little more than a hunch at this point, but I have to say, I'm pretty confident about it. Hopefully time will tell."

There is also ""mirror matter"" (different from anti-matter), which would solve a giant issue as well (parity symmetry). Basically, when particles decay, we find that some decays are ONLY ""left' or ""right"" handed. Imagine a ball spinning around. It can spin one way or the other. If you move the spinning ball in one direction, it adds a certain handedness to the system. A ball moving in the same direction and spinning the opposite way has a different handedness. Opposite direction + opposite spinning = same handedness  Particles have their own ""spin"" and direction of movement. From certain particle decays, we find ONLY one type of handedness where theory says it shouldn't matter, so we should be seeing both equally.  ""Mirror matter"" would be matter that decayed in this other method that we cannot detect, because it doesn't interact in other ways with normal matter (besides gravity).

It varies widely in measurements   While the measurement uncertainty of the gravitational constant is much larger than the strengths of the other fields, it's still only 2 parts per million. That is sufficiently small as to be completely negligible for most of our measurements associated with dark matter, and mostly negligible for the rest. This is simply not a valid criticism; it's a strawman. Statistics is a thing, and the statistics of all our measurements account for that uncertainty, regardless.  > however the discrepancy there is that the mass of molecules is largely dictated by the very high energy subatomic bonds between the quarks.   This only applies to hadrons. It certainly doesn't apply to elementary particles themselves (for example, the top quark is 170 times more massive than a neutron, and *none* of that mass comes from subatomic bonds). No one has ever suggested that dark matter is made up of hadrons, so this criticism doesn't make any sense whatsoever, either.  >I find it hard to understand a form of matter which is able to have so much mass to affect the behavior of galaxies, without the very subatomic source of said mass interacting with the other fundamental forces of the universe.  Perhaps the problem is your lack of imagination, then, along with some ignorance. First of all, there are two ways to have enough mass to affect the gravitation of galaxies (among the [many other](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6488wb/i_dont_want_to_be_anti_science_but_i_am_doubtful/dg05wx4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) related phenomena): lots of low mass particles or fewer high mass ones. We already know of low mass weakly interacting particles: neutrinos. We also know of high mass elementary particles (W±, Z and Higgs Bosons, along with several of the quarks), we just don't know of any such WIMPs – which is to be expected because heavy WIMPs are, by their very nature, extraordinarily hard to detect.  >It also produces a complication that this dark matter is only able to affect large bodies? Why is it that we are unable to see local phenomena which points to it's existance, when modeling smaller systems such as a solar system for example.   Rather than posing this as a question designed to poke holes in the particle model of dark matter, you should have posed it as a question intended to learn the existing answer to it. Once again, the problem here is ignorance, not the theory. It is *expected* that dark matter wouldn't noticeably affect the dynamics of small-scale structures, it's way too sparsely distributed for that. The amount of dark matter within a solar system is negligible. Solar systems are extremely small compared to the distance between stars, which is where most dark matter is. Moreover, dark matter is spread out in a spherical halo, thinning it out even more (in a spiral galaxy like our own) with respect to its density within the solar system, while still having a gravitational effect on the galaxy as a whole. And because gravity is purely attractive, the effect of a \~uniform, low density halo of dark matter over small scales is negligible, while it adds up to significant effects at galactic scales. This is high school level physics.  >Just some late night thoughts and I may be wrong, but the dark matter hypothesis produces more questions than answers, much like string theory  It really doesn't. It answers a dozen questions or more (see my earlier link), and really only poses one big one: what particle(s) make up dark matter? There are some followups to that, but none are the questions you've raised, which all have answers or are based on ignorance or misunderstandings.  It seems to me that you know enough about physics to fool yourself into thinking that you know more about this topic than you really do. The evidence for the particle nature of dark matter has only grown over time, and all other attempts to explain dark matter have failed spectacularly.

Some of the things you're saying suggest you dont seem to understand what evidence is, let alone dark matter.  A brief history of DM to try explain this: one of the first pieces of observational evidence for dark matter was published in paper in 1933 by a scientist called Fritz Zwicky, where, using the virial theorem, he found that galaxies appeared to be rotating much faster than predictions using luminosity would indicate. He concluded that this was because there was a large amount of non-luminous matter in the galaxies, causing them to rotated more quickly. HOWEVER, this could also be taken as observational evidence for certain models of modified newtonian dynamics (the ""gravity works different"" hypothesis (NB unlike dark matter, not theory, hypothesis, as unlike dark matter there isnt enough observational evidence for it to be considered a theory)). Later, various other pieces of observational evidence including, but not limited to, strong+weak gravitational lensing, galaxy formation, type 1a supernovae further confirmed Zwickys theory of missing mass to be correct, and further disproved the hypothesis of MOND. On top of this there is the problem that EVEN WITH CURRENT MOND HYPOTHESES THERE IS STILL SOME MISSING MASS THAT NEEDS AN EXPLANATION.

A reliable source for these particles - this can be something as simple as the sun, which we used for early neutrino detection, or something as complicated as a particle accelerator. The key word here is reliable: our theoretical understanding of the particle has to be complete enough to know where we should be able to find them. If we can’t find them where the math says we should, it’s back to the drawing board. 2.	A reliable way to detect these particles - this gets a lot harder the less frequent/strong that it’s interactions with other particles are. Ernest Rutherford discovered that atoms had a nucleus all the way back in 1909 by wrapping a radioactive element in gold foil and discovering the tiny holes that alpha particles make. Photons took a lot longer since their wave-like properties are far more apparent at macroscopic scales. Neutrinos were even harder, since they only experience the weak interaction, not the much more obvious electromagnetic interaction. AFAIK (could be wrong here), our evidence of the existence of gluons is still rather flimsy to this day due to the ridiculously small scales in which they operate; it just so happens that the standard model sort of “spit them out”, and the entailing mathematical predictions pretty much exactly match our observed reality.  The truth is, any suggestion for an axion detector is entirely theoretical at the moment.  We really don’t know what it would look like in the future."

We can actually measure it on a scale as small as a galaxy (astronomy, man) because our initial predictions of galaxy scale structures predicted that most galaxies we know of simply couldn't exist as we see them unless there was some unseen matter holding them together with gravity but apparently no other interactions. Factoring only the mass we can see or reasonably predict (like stuff behind clouds of gas) would make for galaxies that simply fly apart.  Because of the way stars move in a galaxy, we know that there's dark matter concentrated in the galaxy.  The craziest part is that the distribution is such that stars orbiting the center of their galaxies don't do so at the speeds we expected. You would expect them to orbit at speeds proportional to the size of their orbit, but they actually don't really taper off in speed as much as they should."

It's one unknown thing with specific properties that we've been able to measure.   We know that dark matter interacts with itself and other matter gravitationally. It has mass. We know that dark matter doesn't emit light. We know galaxies usually have a lot of dark matter associated with them, but dark matter is distributed differently. It's more spread out and not as concentrated as normal matter. When dark matter collides with dark matter, it doesn't clump and condense like normal matter does, it just passes right on through.  We can measure dark matter. We can measure the orbital velocities of stars near the outskirts of galaxies and determine that there is more mass in the far reaches of galaxies than is visible.  We can look at colliding clusters of galaxies like the Bullet Cluster and measure the degree of gravitational lensing around the cluster, which allows us to measure mass. We can determine that although the dust and gas clouds of those galaxies slowed down, the dark matter did not (as much). Here you have an example where the dark matter and the normal matter measurably does not line up.  We've also recently found galaxies without very much dark matter -- in some ultra diffuse galaxies, the rotation curves match what would be expected just with their visible matter.  There are other examples where the dark matter hypothesis is confirmed by observation of the cosmos (like the studies of the Cosmic Microwave Background), but those are the ones I'm familiar with.

In vaccines this is obvious - the patient gets better.   In particle physics, we simulate the events that would be generated if the effect is real. This is our ""signal"" sample. We then simulate all the processes we know about, and add them together - the ""background"" sample.   To verify this, you look at a region where you expect no or very little signal based on your simulation, and check that the background sample matches your data - this tests that your estimation is good.   Finally, you plot the signal, background and data on one graph in the region you expect a strong signal. If the data mostly lines up with the background, the effect (probably) isn't real. If it lines up with signal+background, you've made a discovery.  You can see this in [this recent plot](https://cds.cern.ch/images/ATLAS-PHOTO-2018-020-2/file?size=large)  measuring the higgs mass.

Physicists have been trying, but no other ideas that anyone has been able to come up with work even a tenth as well as the WIMP model of dark matter. In fact, as time has passed, the evidence continues to mount for this model at the expense of the others that have been suggested.   The argument that “we haven’t found anything in two decades, so let’s just give up” is fundamentally flawed. Neutrinos weren’t found until 26 years after their prediction. It took almost as long to find the top quark, too. The thing is, when your hypothesis is that something is well-explained by the existence of particles that *must* be weakly interacting, and therefore very difficult to detect, then it’s *not unexpected* for it to prove elusive.   Measurements to date have disproved some dark matter candidates, and imposed limits on others. But there are plenty of WIMP candidates that we simply do not currently have the means or the facilities to expect to find them with any degree of certainty.   TL;DR If you’re not a physicist working in the field, you might not be aware of that fact that people have and continue to try to “rethink” the dark matter problem.

At my Uni at least, the pre-requisites work out such that you can't take *introductory* General Relativity until your senior year of undergrad. And that's just a basic, first look at GR. Unless high schoolers are learning tensor calculus over where you are, I don't see how high schoolers can have anything close to an understanding of *actual* GR. Knowing some basic concepts behind GR doesn't mean you actually understand the field by any measure.  And Quantum Field Theory isn't even taught until Grad School. To actually get a proper understanding of the field takes more time still.  Which is why I'd like to ask, for a third time now, how much have you learned about GR? You haven't answered the question."

It is a question that’s all about perspective.  Hell, faster than light travel could be argued as not being as major a break through as a process that allows us to survive a trip to a habitable planet even at faster than light speed (this is super hypothetical).  Right now discovering the identity of the particle or energy responsible for dark matters influence on the universal observations we make is a huge discovery for knowledge sake but practical value wouldn’t be instantaneous.  I’m a biochemist studying the medical applications of snake venom that I extract.  The venoms I’m working with haven’t been well characterized and the potential for new anti-metastatics, diagbostics, clotting and blood pressure medications as well as analgesics is very real.  I don’t think what I’m doing is the most significant dissertation ever written, not by a long shot.  But it’s very significant to me and could be very significant to some people if the research pans out.  I used to just do transects counts  in the Amazon and East Africa, watching numbers decline even as we found new species.  However important this still is (and ecology is important) to me it  seemed to require a practical approach to convince people why they should care at all about the decline of biodiversity in animals that are generally reviled.   I don’t disagree with you.  We don’t know what discoveries link to what.  I couldn’t do what I do without HPLC/ Mass Spec/electrophoresis/ dozens of other technologies only in existence because of advances in physics/chemistry/and engineering.  I of course agree no discipline exists in a bubble... but human scientists are not capable of understanding fringe science in every discipline.  So scientific discoveries need to be considered and looked at both in individual practical senses, and theoretical senses, for every field.  Trying to argue anything in any one field is the biggest scientific discovery of our time is like arguing about what the greatest movie or band in our time was.  I suppose you could go by citations and influence... but is that truly an accurate measure either?  I don’t disagree with you, I just think that within a field you might get some kind of consensus, but amount all of science it’s too diverse (interconnected, yes, but diverse).   How would you compare Faster than light travel, or a probe beyond the event horizon of a black hole, with nanotechnology capable of neuronal regeneration without limit and the ability to deliver specific drugs to specific cells with perfect accuracy.  I’m just saying some things are incomparable because no person can hold the scope of both in their mind at once and even if one could, their opinion shouldn’t speak for all scientists.  That’s all I was trying to say.  I shouldn’t have made it seem like I was disagreeing. With the idea that it could be the biggest discovery... just that it is impossible to come to a consensus on such a thing."

When you make a prediction, you don't get to predict a specific single outcome. You predict a probability distribution over outcomes. Like, suppose you are predicting the results of someone rolling two six-sided dice. But you don't get to see or hear the dice, you just get to see the results. They're following some set of rules that aren't just 'throw the dice'.   Some really noticeable signals were like as long as all the dice showing are 1, throw an additional die. Very very obvious. I mean, there's an extra die just sitting there, and sometimes 2, or rarely 3. Something weird just happened. And only one of the dice is not 1.  A lesser signal would be like if whenever they got a total of 9, they replace the lowest die with the median of the lower die and two freshly rolled dice (remove the other two). You're going to see a bit less of 9… but it could still take a bit longer while to notice. It can also very rarely produce a case where you have 1+1+1+6 or 1+1+1+1+5, and one of the 1s is replaced with something not a 1. This is triggered more often, but it's harder to notice when it does, except in that rare case  A difficult to get signal might be like, ""When you have a 2 and a 5 showing, take them away. Roll 30 dice at once. If there is a 2 among them, keep it. If there is a 5, keep it. Then throw everything else away."" It triggers frequently, but doesn't do anything very often, and it doesn't seem suspicious unless you look closely at the distribution.  The axion signal might be, ""If at any moment, you are showing at least 20 fours, stop whatever you're doing and set the result to 1, 1, 2.""  That is, it disguises a very rare case as a modestly rare case.  BUT, in real life, even aside from the possibility space being much larger, there are lots of rules like that already, and they're chained together, and you're looking at inserting another rule like that in the middle. So in order to make any sort of prediction, they have to run the simulations like you describe… and it still takes them a long time to sort out what they saw, and it takes a LOT of runs."

It's all about whether they interact with regular particles and fields that we can easily detect.  Photon hits a surface, it almost always interacts with that surface. Electron hits an atom, almost always interacts with the atom.  Neutrinos hit an atom, they don't interact, they pass through. It takes a gazillion neutrinos passing through an atom to maybe have a small chance to interact with the atom. That's why they are so difficult to detect. Not because they are small (they aren't smaller than a photon), but because they don't interact with matter.  Dark matter, whatever it is made of, is similar.

The theory is that axions are able to convert into photons. These photons are hypothesized to be in the microwave range, and the exact frequency (energy) of the resulting photon is dependent on the mass of the axion. If the axion particle exists and they tune the resonant frequency of the microwave chamber correctly, they should be able to detect this happening. It's less the particle interacting with microwaves and more the particle *becoming* microwaves. That's why its mass-dependent.  IANA particle physicist so my explanation is probably wrong somewhat, haha.  Edit: I should probably add that in direct answer to your question, no, there isnt a particle size vs frequency for microwave interactions on the whole. However, for what they are looking for in the experiment we know how to remove most of the noise. We know generally what can happen with particles we already know. At any frequency there is going to be lots of noise in the data. The idea is that if we find that perfect resonant frequency to match with the axion's mass, we will see an extra signal that isn't present at other frequencies. There's more work to be done then to make sure its a real signal and rule out other possible interactions that could cause it. But we first have to find that small signal at a specific frequency before we can do the work on making sure its an axion."

Because any elementary particle that satisfies the criteria of this experiment would also satisfy the dark-matter candidate conditions.

That's an even number. Secondly electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force are all broken symmetries of each other.

The concept of energy warping space-time can be understood, and is taught along with relativity. Everybody knows what e=mc2 means, now understanding the math which explains it is entirely different.  I would strongly disagree with that. Knowing concepts is far and away from actually understanding the theory, because the math *is* the theory. Saying you can understand the theory without understanding the math is like saying that you can understand Shakespeare without knowing what words are.    >I was a CS major, so I only had to take gen phys 2 electric and magnetism. I wasn't really interested in theoretical physics until much later. I believe I have a good understanding.  Why do you believe your understanding is good? How would you know? I mean, maybe you self-studied after the fact, but if all you took was a gen physics course, I don't see how you could have a good understanding. Or at least a better understanding than physicists who have spent decades studying the topic. Physics goes waaaaaaay deeper than what is presented in a gen physics course. It's a really deep and weird rabbit hole with many intuitive results. I really do think you should take the Dunning–Kruger effect into account here.   I'm sorry, I know I'm being a bit anal about this, but I just think that it's the height of arrogance to say that you know more about a topic than people who have spent decades studying it when you yourself haven't taken anything more than a basic course. It's like giving Micheal Phelps swimming tips when you just learned how to not drown last week."

This happens if dark matter couples to a strongly-coupled nearly-conformal hidden sector. This type of theory is holographically described by brane-localized dark matter interacting with bulk fields in a slice of 5D anti-de Sitter space. The long-range potential in this scenario depends on a non-integer power of the spatial separation, in contrast to the Yukawa potential generated by the exchange of a single 4D mediator. The resulting self-interaction cross section scales like a non-integer power of velocity.

Such an instrument is the turbo encabulator. Now basically the only new principle involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance. The original machine had a base plate of pre-famulated amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring on the “up” end of the grammeters. The turbo-encabulator has now reached a high level of development, and it’s being successfully used in the operation of novertrunnions. Moreover, whenever a forescent skor motion is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm, to reduce sinusoidal repleneration.    "

Later the notion of extra spacial dimensions was used to explain why gravity was far weaker than the week nuclear force, for example."

You then try to use that solution as a starting point or a guide for a more complicated system.

This idea takes a riff off that. Maybe the dark matter (better yet, missing matter) is hiding in other dimensions in a way we can't directly see, but can infer at the cosmological scale because of how gravity should explain the movements of stars and galaxies, but doesn't because there doesn't seem to be enough matter to explain the movement.  Perhaps the loosely coupled interactions of these other dimensions with our observable ones creates drag on our universe like gravity wakes that could explain the missing dark matter.

It does within each Brane, so within our universe we see stellar disks and galaxies flatten out into the net angular momentum of the mass cloud.

We can't see the planets, can't even begin to fathom their collective mass, and so we can't really account for that potential mass in computer simulations of large-scale gravitational effects. Now, one could make assumptions in their model and determine just how many/how large the planets in a galaxy would have to be to accurately reflect what is already observed. That puts constraints on the whole thing, so if you make these loose assumptions and still get something WAY off what you're expecting, your have to keep looking. That's pretty much where we are right now.  this allows fathoming some pretty exotic things. For example, what if there are a bunch of neutron stars that have stopped spinning and cooled and are just giant balls of tightly compacted neutrons floating around in space? Our technology wouldn't be able to detect such things, but their collective mass could be enormous and contribute to the large-scale gravitational effects we see. (Note that I've just contrived such ""cold"" neutron stars, but it's as good a theory as any other with about as much evidence, which is to say none at all)."

"nv33sy","New Study Says an Extra-Dimension May Explain Dark Matter","h1222h6","MissTetraHyde","I think you know this, but it's just a negation of the type of space, not de Sitter. In this case the opposite of a closed universe is an open one. But I had a laugh at what you wrote, just like it seems you did. It isn't that de Sitter was wrong, he just wrote the physics of a universe with a positive spatial curvature. It so happens, unfortunately for de Sitter, that we live in a universe that we don't believe has such a curve. If we did then the universe would curve in on itself and thus would be closed, like a Pacman game. Just like you can represent a game of Pacman as a 2 dimensional shape being superimposed upon a torus, you can represent a closed universe as a 3 dimensional space superimposed onto a hyper-sphere. So we think we live in a universe that doesn't do that, which we call anti-de Sitter space.   On a mildly unrelated note - you can stretch anti-de Sitter space onto a geometric form just like you can de Sitter space, you just have to use a ""hyper-hyperbola"" to do it. This means the paper says that, essentially (as far as I can tell, I may be wrong of course), that you can represent dark matter using a bunch of 5-dimensional membranes (planes more or less, just not flat in 2 dimensions but more than 2, unless you have a singular point, which is a 1-brane technically) hitting into a 5 dimensional hyperbola with the spatial features of our universe. The other bits describe exactly how it hits the thing. In this case it has to kind of pass through it most of the time, and it says that this outcome describing the probability of a collision is related to the relative velocity of the two structures and the actual literal value of exactly how negatively curved the ""hyper-hyperbola"" actually is. I would need to read the paper in more depth to understand exactly what they mean by ""velocity"" though, since as far as I know that relies on frame-of-reference generally and that likely means there has to be some kind of relativity implication here that they'd have to work around. They say the hyperbola is filled with ""bulk fields"" which is actually a phrase I'm not familiar with, though, so it gets more complicated than I've described here if you go into it. I think, from a quick google, a bulk field is an unbounded one. So I think they mean the hyperbola is the shape of our universe, and even though the hyperbola is bounded, the fields inside of it are not, since the universe never ends in an open space with negative curvature (like the inverse of a Klein bottle which instead of being essentially unbounded with a finite interior, this is a bounded space with an infinite interior\*\*). This would be a very complicated explanation, obviously, and because it involves fields and relativity it likely means that you can't prove this without a Grand Unified Theory that explains how the Standard Model and Relativity fit together.  \*\* A good explanation would be if a 2d creature lived on the inner surface of a 3-hyperbola. No matter which directions she goes, she will never get enough information about the bounds of the hyperbola because the bounds are infinitely long along the line she can never exceed in a 3rd dimension, but that doesn't mean the line doesn't exist as a bounds of the universe she lives in (e.g. y^2 / a^2 - x^2 / b^2 = 1 has infinitely many solutions between it and the origin/axis, but the set of solutions is bounded by that line). Or more formally than saying the bounds are finite and the interior is infinite, a better way would be to say that the size of the infinities are different (so like Aleph 0 vs. Aleph 1 or something similar). One of the infinities is bounded, but the other one is not bounded in the same way.  tl;dr:  You can describe dark matter mathematically, if you choose the rules right, as a flat 5-dimensional thing hitting another 5-dimensional thing that is shaped like a slice of the universe that we live in and completely filled with ""liquid physics"" (fields).  Or: throw a 5-d sheet at a 4-d anti-circle and you can use the rules they give and get a result that looks like dark matter in our actual universe."

In some cases it might make sense to take that parameter to be very close to 4, calling it ""4+epsilon"" where epsilon is supposed to be ""small"". You solve the problem which gives you an answer as a function of dimension. Then you plug in or take a limit as d goes to the value you care about.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_regularization  Hopefully if you compute the answer for 4+epsilon and you really wanted 3 dimensions taking epsilon to be -1 is still accurate enough."

"nv33sy","New Study Says an Extra-Dimension May Explain Dark Matter","h1arr4g","MissTetraHyde","Yes a dimension is just an extra number essentially, another scalar. The constraint is just that it has to be a new degree of freedom. If a particle already has a heat at time x and you take it's heat again at time x+a you haven't gotten another dimension, just another data point along the same 2 dimensions (time-ness and heat-ness). However, if you suddenly have a particle that goes from not having electroweak interactions to suddenly having them, that particle has gained extra dimensions (ignoring that there are different semantic games you can play with the phrase ""gained dimensions"" with regard to hidden dimensions & etc.).  Also I don't believe physics at this level would recognize hunger as a ""dimension"" since it isn't an inherent part of reality, but rather an emergent property of the interactions of the collection of particles that is called ""you"". The hungry you isn't any more dimensional than the un-hungry you; both of you have a non-fundamental scalar called ""hungry"" and being hungry or not hungry is just a value on that scale.  edit: To be ultra clear, though, I don't think that technically heat is a dimension. Heat is another way of saying the enthalpy of system, which is just a hand-wave for averaging things like momentum and inelastic/elastic collision, which is itself a hand-wave of electromagnetic interactions and other things. Heat is the measure of disorder associated with a system and is thus an emergent property too: non-fundamental. In my opinion, physics makes more sense if you consider dimensions only amongst fundamental properties, because otherwise dimension just becomes another word for measurement (Also if you need to be a certain scale to measure a ""dimension"" it would have implications about the homogeneity of the universe and physics, but to be fair that is basically exactly what M theory involves, so it's not impossible/wrong).  But to be clear, I think your explanation is a lot better than the common ones (I'm just being nit-picky). Also I think thermodynamics [uses the phrase dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_function#Overview) differently in some contexts, so that may also be a reason for the difference."

That's simply arrogance.  That framework and that modeling are grounded in the assumption of logic.  Of cause and effect.  As I've gotten older, I've come to accept that there's probably a lot about the universe that simply isn't logical, and doesn't have to obey logic or obey cause and effect.  Point in case: I have The Sims on my computer.  The game has ""laws of physics"" and events in it operate via a framework grounded in logic.  However, I, the guy playing the game, can drop a unicorn from the sky if I want to.  I can do whatever I want, logic from the perspective of the more closed minded and intellectually arrogant beings in the game be damned.  The ""laws of physics"" and ""logic"" are simply an illusion.  If you continue to develop intellectually, you'll probably eventually go down the same path.  A hallmark of high intelligence is knowing that you actually barely know anything.  If there are bits and pieces of knowledge about things that are grander than ""logic"" and ""cause and effect"", you might find traces of those bits and pieces here and there in the one and only thing we have that is a continuous compilation tens of thousands of years of collective human experience: religion.

The funny thing about math is that various forms can be remarkably similar. The same math can explain completely different things. The equations for gravitational lensing are equivalent to basic refraction, for instance. Perhaps there's no gravitational lensing. Perhaps it's just particles acting as a lense, for instance. Though, that's really besides the point. The point is the same math can describe very different physical phenomenon.  RelMOND is basically as good as LCDM in many ways. Very different approaches with similar results in many cases.  We know we have a dark gravity problem. Gravity is just not very well understood across vast (cosmic to subatomic) scales.  The interesting bit is that by 'fixing gravity' both dark matter and dark energy may become entirely unneeded, or at least significantly reduced in magnitude. That's appealing as it's simpler, ya know, ol occums razor.  Yet our best models (regardless) still fail too frequently. So we still haven't got it right."

People who weren't around for it or weren't paying attention back when we started detecting planets outside of our solar system won't remember that we used to think that most stars did not have planets orbiting them. Now we think that every star has at least a few. This is a relatively recent development as well. People don't realize that we are in the middle of discovery in cosmology and astrophysics because making observations at these scales is a very difficult thing to do. The fact that what we observe is incorrect by 5 times the theoretical number is actually still pretty impressive. Go back a little over 100 years ago and we thought that our galaxy was the entire universe. Looking at the history of cosmology and astronomy, the idea that we are still not seeing everything is so obvious that it makes something like WIMPs seem so foolishly overcomplicated and inadvertently biased.

Rev. Lett. **116**, 201301 (2016).](https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.201301)  > **Abstract:** We consider the possibility that the black-hole (BH) binary detected by LIGO may be a signature of dark matter. Interestingly enough, there remains a window for masses 20M⊙≲Mbh≲100M⊙ where primordial black holes (PBHs) may constitute the dark matter. If two BHs in a galactic halo pass sufficiently close, they radiate enough energy in gravitational waves to become gravitationally bound. The bound BHs will rapidly spiral inward due to the emission of gravitational radiation and ultimately will merge. Uncertainties in the rate for such events arise from our imprecise knowledge of the phase-space structure of galactic halos on the smallest scales. Still, reasonable estimates span a range that overlaps the 2–53  Gpc^−3 yr^−1 rate estimated from GW150914, thus raising the possibility that LIGO has detected PBH dark matter. PBH mergers are likely to be distributed spatially more like dark matter than luminous matter and have neither optical nor neutrino counterparts. They may be distinguished from mergers of BHs from more traditional astrophysical sources through the observed mass spectrum, their high ellipticities, or their stochastic gravitational wave background. Next-generation experiments will be invaluable in performing these tests."

So, from what I'm understanding -- as mass falls into the BH, it radiates energy as heat and that's what is being measured through CMB?

"4phmtm","Physicists suggest we might have just found dark matter while detecting gravitational waves.","d4lxml8","Deleted","Dark matter is essentially a placeholder.  For example let's say you wanted to know why a car cost 5,000$ to manufacture. This is a special car, it's 1,000 years old and rusted.   You know it costs 5,000$ this is a known value. So you start delving deep, find out labor accounts for 2,000$, find out all the metal work, tires and fabrication costs 2,950$.  You just can't find out where that other 50$ went to. You accounted for 4,950$, but you know it costs 5,000$.  So you label it ""Dark Cost"" you know it's there, it's hidden, you can't find it. Yet you are sure it's there.   So you think logically and say ""What could cost 50$?"" and someone says it must of been the cost of some screws that are too rusted to account for, the screw model of dark cost, another says decayed and washed away sealant, the o-ring model of dark cost; and yet another purposes the cost of paint; the primordial second paint job.  You don't know what it could be, you know of some cars that didn't need o-rings, and some cars that didn't need screws, cars had a single coat of paint, so you just don't get it. You can't claim any is the answer, or if it's a combination of all three.  Then you find evidence that the car had an issue with the paint job and required a second coat of paint through some very clever forensic work. You found the hidden cost.  It could of ended up being screws that are now gone, you assumed it used rivots but all you are left with is holes and rusted metal. No threads to be seen, but the rusted metal could of had threads. Rubber seals might of been used, but you know an engine could of had such good tolerances a rubber seal might not of been needed, and since the car is in such decay you can't find your answer because you don't know the initial conditions. So you need constantly better tools and forensics to find the true answer.   You know the dark cost is there. What it is; is the problem we need to locate.  Turns out dark matter might be primordial black holes. We know dark matter is there, but it could of been primordial black holes, unseen matter, collection of new particles, new particle, or even just underestimating due to collected data higher occurrences of known particles.

The idea is that the signal being picked up isn't the Hawking radiation, but rather the gravitational waves being generated by the binary system of BHs. The amplitude of these waves is proportional to the masses of the BHs which produce them, so the amplitude of the waves tells you something about the mass of the system of BHs that you're getting waves from.  You can put pretty fixed limits on how much mass a BH should have  at any given time in the history of the universe based on the current age of the universe and the means by which the BH was produced - BHs produced by the core collapse of a star are necessarily only produced by stars above a given mass - so if you've got a good idea of when stars first started forming in the universe (which we do), and you also have a good idea of when the first core-collapse black hole formed, and how long it's been since then, that means you have a good idea of the mass of the smallest possible core-collapse black hole that can exist at the current age of the universe.  But PBHs aren't formed by core collapse; they would've formed due to the high density of matter during the early universe. That means they've been around a lot longer, so they've had the time to loss more mass due to Hawking radiation, and they formed by a different mechanism, so their starting mass could be quite different.  I'm pretty sure the upshot of the paper is then that ""We looked at the size of the waves this black hole binary system produced and it suggests that these black holes have less mass than the oldest core-collapse black hole produced by the smallest dying star, which suggests these black holes are primordial black holes and not core-collapse black holes, and are therefore a good candidate for the extraneous mass we seem to need for the galaxy to be like it is.""

"4phmtm","Physicists suggest we might have just found dark matter while detecting gravitational waves.","d4lh844","AmeliaLeah","When a BH forms from a star usually the star has been gaining mass and burning energy, and has enough iron in its core to trigger a core collapse and shockwave out. The collapse is because the core CANNOT fuse iron, so the nuclear fusion pressure drops and gravity takes over. In a split second all those atoms from helium to iron either get blown away (outer shell) or collapse in to the black hole.   In the beginning of the universe there *wasn't* a thing such as hydrogen, helium, or any of the elements. What existed were the parts that would become matter. Those pre-Periodic Table particles don't interact with the forces we observe daily (E&M,strong/weak nuclear, gravity),in the way we observe them now. They would be able to form black holes differently than a super-nova and allow for a different range of masses of BH's to exist. "

The process turns out to be very sensitive to the density of matter. If there's too much or too little, the initial ratio of hydrogen to helium-3 and helium-4 would be different. If you turn back the clock and do the math with the baryonic matter density we can observe now (excluding any dark matter) we get exactly the right ratios for the light elements. Having enough matter to make a lot of black holes later on would change the light element abundances from we know they were.  It looks like the way these researchers avoided that problem is by saying that the black holes were primordial, i.e. formed earlier than the light nuclei did, and so didn't affect BBN."

Even if the community tends to incline more towards a certain theory, if the theory is proven wrong by experiment we'll not hesitate (unless the experiment is questionable) to throw that theory in the trash and look at other alternatives that usually are being studied simultaneously.  Also I think you don't understand how we don't understand things: >The expansion of the universe must be a result of some mysterious dark energy and could not possibly be the result of some simpler phenomenon not yet thought of.  Well, we can't discuss something that we haven't thought of yet right? But if we have some unexplainable experimental results we have to try to explain them right? Ok, first question every physicst ask himself ""what's the simplest way to explain this using the body of knowledge I already know?"" then you and thousands more of the brightest in the world think about this for 30 years and don't get anything reasonable. What now? Do you give up? No, you try and explain it with new physics. You change the question to ""what's the simplest *change* I can make to the body of knowledge I already know that will explain this?"". And guess what? It turns out adding just a little term to Einstein's equations solves all of our problems (when a minor change in your theory solves a lot of problems in said theory it's usually a good way to measure if you're in the right track). Seems pretty simple to me. Now, we don't actually know where this term comes from, we just added it (that's why we call it dark). It doesn't mean that we take this for granted, it means it's the most plausible option we've thought of.

To counteract this possibility, Einstein added the cosmological constant.[5] However, soon after Einstein developed his static theory, observations by Edwin Hubble indicated that the universe appears to be expanding; this was consistent with a cosmological solution to the original general relativity equations that had been found by the mathematician Friedmann, working on the Einstein equations of general relativity.

As soon as the large quantities of energy were converted to matter a black hole would be able to form due to the property of mass being given. Equally sized black holes would form from equally portioned gases.   With such large quantities of mass simultaneously forming, you must imagine that the dimensions of space would have been effected in such a radical way as to go from no-gravity force upon it to all of gravity's force upon it. It literally switched sides of an equation somewhere.   Can anyone let me know if this makes any sense, I'm a layman.   Further, if black holes are evenly distributed around us in halos, would their gravity be pulling us in all directions possibly causing the stretching of space that we see? I.E Dark energy?    Is the limit of our observable universe governed by the event horizons of a black hole halo warping everything?   Our area of the universe (not all black holes, the parts with matter.) may be explained by as follows. (maybe haha)  As the first generation of black holes form, spherical in dimension, the largest (upper limit ) amounts of elementary particles ( dispersed equally ) would determine the size of the event horizons of the largest black holes until their event horizons touched. There would be left over equal amounts of elementary particles in 3D space around them created by the warping of spacetime by the surrounding gravities.   These elementary particles also form a smaller but maximum sized black hole in the left over space between the horizons of the larger black holes around them, until event horizons are touched, again separating more equal portions of 3D space again warped by the lattice of gravity around them. It's fractal in nature.   Because the original and most massive black holes were not subject to a generation of gravity effects before them, they pull on one another equally without disturbance. And they pull on the smaller black holes equally in the spaces between their larger touching spherical horizons, creating a uniform distortion, a perceived stretching.   These smaller and larger first and second generation black holes are all still evenly distributed, all exacting an equal gravitational pull on each other to varying degrees of intensity creating different measures of stretching locally.    Eventually the required and necessary limit for matter not to collapse into a black hole would be reached. That mass of elementary particles is defined by the decreasingly smaller partitions between the previous generation of black holes.   The first gas star(s) would be formed sometime around here at it's(their) upper limit(s) out of the available mass, I imagine, and would also collapse into a black hole(s).  I have limited mathematical education, but I like to read a lot.   Someone please put my mind to rest, if only to tell me how and where I went wrong. I'd love to understand. "

Consequences of most other possibilities are also weighed in and room in our known knowledge is found as well. Dark matter is an idea with observational properties not a defined thing. There is a possibility that it could be something like the Mercury's orbit and the belief in another planet near the sun, but with the amount of evidence such a thing is unlikely and would have other effects. The idea isn't eliminated though, but it would need to be as revolutionary as relativity. Observations and conclusions like this are the basis of a lot of science and discovery.

Any type of hypothetical matter we cannot observe proposed as a possible cause of this phenomenon.   There's multiple different hypothesis of dark matter. One, and the most commonly accepted, is a type of matter that doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum, thus making observing it with light impossible. [Another idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole), however, was that dark matter consists of many black holes we cannot observe with the technology available to us at this time, which is still dark matter in the sense of ""matter we cannot (yet) observe causing this phenomenon.""

What this paper does is to consider a merging pair of PBH's of mass 30 M_solar, within the allowed region, and, making some possibly reasonable assumptions, show that the merger rate is consistent with the inferred rate from LIGO. That is, LIGO has made an estimate for the rate at which we should observe BH mergers around that mass,  and the authors compute a theoretical merger rate for PBHs of that mass around what was observed by LIGO. Therefore, the LIGO results do no rule out PBHs a source for the observed signal.

The idea is that space repels, gravitationally in much the opposite way that matter attracts gravitationally. But it is assumed that a lack of matter means no gravitational effect whatsoever. We have a zero in an equation where there should be a -1, if you will. The dark matter, or unaccounted mass in the universe surrounding galaxies is nothing more than a balancing of the repelling force of empty space and the attracting force of a great deal of matter. Here there is an *actual* zero gravitational force. But since we assumed that space was 0 the balance shows up in equations as a +1. Or ""dark matter."" The repelling force is also what would explain the expansion of and the acceleration of the expansion of space. As greater areas of space open up the force increases. There is no missing matter. There is only an anti gravitational force of vast quantities of nothing and it is constant in the universe, though negated in our normal day to day living because of all the matter which negates and obscures it."

Essentially there is a big equation and we know what the answer is, but there is a missing variable, that variable is dark matter and dark energy. This variable could turn out to be a number of things or one thing, we aren't sure yet.   For instance, neutrinos have mass so they interact gravitationally, but only extremely rarely do they interact any other way, which means they could be a portion of the dark matter variable we are missing.   Also black holes interact in a few ways but they are extremely difficult to observe directly but we can tell where they are based on how their gravity affects other bodies. Because when we look at them they look like empty space and we can only see secondary effects caused by their gravity a whole lot of black holes are also a candidate for a portion of the dark matter variable.

Frankly, it's probably smaller bits of junk that have weak gravity signals that would be more dangerous than anything, as they would only be detected at extremely short range (relatively speaking) because something like radar would have to be used.

In fact, black holes are notably lighter than their mother star was, before it collapsed, and every star that currently has a mass larger than 7 times the Sun's mass, is theorized to become a black hole eventually.  Black holes are formed when the fusion processes of a large star has created such a large amount of heavy minerals in the star's core, that the star collapses in on itself. This collapse generates a huge amount of energy, by virtue of which, the outer layers of the star are pushed away, which we observe as SuperNovas, a term, you may have heard of.  Remaining then is either a Neutron Star, or a black hole, depending on exactly how much mass was contained in the star. The resulting black hole is, however, much lighter than the star was initially :)"

"4phmtm","Physicists suggest we might have just found dark matter while detecting gravitational waves.","d4lssx8","7LeagueBoots","It's not really about gravitational force.  If Hawking Radiation exists, which is still debatable, my understanding is that it's about the surface area to mass ratio.  It's been a while since I read up on it, but the idea is that there are virtual pair particles that pop into being and almost immediately annihilate each other, *except* in microscopically close proximity to the event horizon of a black hole.  In that particular location one particle, anti-particle or posi-particle, doesn't matter as they're both subject to gravitation, gets pulled into the black hole and the other winds up existing in a more-or-less permanent sense.  This process draws matter from the black hole and causes it to evaporate via conservation of matter and energy.  A large black hole has too much mass compared to its surface for this to have any real effect, but for a small black hole this would have a large effect.  It's a slow process and if a solar mass black hole was formed when the universe formed it would still be here now, much reduced in mass, of course.  One of the problems with the primordial black hole idea, aside from the idea itself and the question whether Hawking Radiation actually exists, is that we should see periodic *massive* explosions as black holes collapse, but ,so far, we don't.  There is a telescope up to look for these explosions, bit it has not been up for long and hasn't seen anything so far.  "
"4phmtm","Physicists suggest we might have just found dark matter while detecting gravitational waves.","d4m3zpf","DipIntoTheBrocean","So I actually don't know a whole lot about primordial black holes in particular, but I feel comfortable fielding then other two questions.  Every black hole will eventually dissipate due to the emission of Hawking Radiation - that is correct. However, the rate at which they emit that radiation is actually much slower the more massive the hole is. So miscroscopic black holes can dissipate within nanoseconds while enormous ones could take trillions of years. Also, these black holes likely continued to feed on other matter, sustaining them more."

They absolutely do not only entertain that idea. It's just the hypothesis of dark matter as some sort of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP for short) is by far the most successful model that we have so far. It can simultaneously explain a wide variety of phenomena, whereas other ideas can be tweaked to be consistent with one observation, but inevitably end up inconsistent with others.  >some sort of invisible particle that is everywhere but so far undetectable  Also, people latch onto this as if it's some crazy idea, but it's really not. Neutrinos are the second most abundant class of particles in the universe (after photons), and only interact via the weak force and gravity - just like WIMPs would do. A hundred trillion neutrinos pass through your body every second of your life, and we have to use 50,000 tons of ultra pure water to detect just a few of these particles in a *day*. To put hard numbers to this, we are only able to detect about one neutrino for every 10^19 neutrinos that pass through our detectors.  Neutrinos are actually a component of dark matter. They do not radiate, so we don't see them with telescopes, but they do interact gravitationally. However, since we have specialized detectors that can occasionally see them, we can estimate how many there are and we find that there are far too few to account for the phenomena that we attribute to dark matter.  So there is already precedent for particles that are ""invisible and everywhere"" and until quite recently, undetectable.  On top of that, we know that the Standard Model of Particle Physics is incomplete. It is actually inconsistent in some places (for example, it predicts that neutrinos should be massless, but they actually do have very tiny, but not zero, mass). Likewise it's what we call a ""low energy effective field theory,"" which means that in constructing it, we made the assumption that we're operating below a certain energy scale - and if we want to look at higher energies we probably need to expand on our current model.  Interestingly enough, most extensions to the Standard Model predict the existence of particles that have all the properties one would expect of WIMPy dark matter. It is, in my opinion, actually naive to think that there *shouldn't* be particles that are very hard to detect - just because we interact with the world through electromagnetism doesn't mean that everything else in the universe must, too. And if there are heavy particles that do not interact electromagnetically, then they are naturally very hard to find and so *of course* we couldn't easily detect them...  I'd just like to end by restating that even though the particle nature of dark matter is by far the most popular among physicists right now, it is absolutely not the only avenue being explored. It's just the most successful model that we have. Alternative ideas include modified gravity, and you just read an article suggesting yet another alternative involving primordial black holes...   Actually, that proves a great point. The possibility of primordial black holes accounting for dark matter is an OLD idea that has been around for decades. It had very little support, though, because we have never been able to confirm the existence of such black holes, let alone estimate how many of them there are. Since there was no evidence of the existence of such black holes, if we apply the logic you use to argue against the existence of WIMPs, we should have cast aside this possible explanation because it requires assuming the existence of things that we have never observed.  Just because we have never observed something does *not* mean we have no evidence for its existence. It just remains indirect. For example, the existence of gravitational waves was confirmed in 1993 by observations of a binary neutron star. No gravitational waves were detected, but the system behaved *exactly* as predicted by general relativity, accounting for the emission of these waves. This year LIGO directly detected gravitational waves - but physicists already knew that they exist. What got us excited was that this proved that we can measure them, and therefore that we can start using them to learn more about the world."

"4phmtm","Physicists suggest we might have just found dark matter while detecting gravitational waves.","d4mlsno","beefprime","The spinning is actually the result of the collapse of a bunch of matter (as opposed to being flung out).  You generally start with a diffuse 3 dimensional cloud of matter, and that cloud can become compressed due to gravity or shockwaves from outside the cloud can set off a collapse, as the cloud collapses gravitational interactions tend to cancel out any angular momentum that doesnt match the net angular momentum of the cloud as a whole, so the final state of the cloud is a much smaller, much denser (relatively) 2 dimensional disc of material that has much faster rotation than the original cloud.  Im not sure what the difference would be if dark matter came after or came before (as far as I know dark matter was created along with everything else so everything we see already has the effects of it baked in).   Properties of dark matter as far as I know is that it doesnt react to gravity but it does project its own gravity, so if I had to guess I'd say it would slow down gravitational collapse over large scales but increase it on small scales, with the collapse being largely unaffected in its final results either way (i.o.w. it will end up in a disc, though that disc will spin quicker than you would think because unlike the disc material, the dark matter DID NOT collapse with the initial cloud's matter because the dark matter is not affected by gravity, so the dark matter that is still diffuse in all directions will have gravitational pull on the disc matter in an outward direction, resulting in faster rotation)"

Since the energy of a wave is distributed across its wave front, as the wave front grows the energy decreases over r^2. If the relative distance between the source and the receiver is constant then you are left with alot of possible solutions that satisfy the resulting questions. But say things move and the relative distance changes, then the variables haveto satisfy two equations and the range narrows, and then the third measurement further restricts. So over time the range of solar masses will get more accurate until they plateau. This plateau may be extremely precise or rather large range depending on the complexity of the relative motion between the two objects.  NOTE: Parallax comes into picture here, will likely end up going into the uncertainty originally until we get a strong enough grasp on it.

Gravitational lensing is caused by all mass, not just black holes. So en masse gravitational lensing looks the same, whether it's a swarm of black holes or a cloud of invisible gas^1.  However, you're right that on the individual scale black holes would look different from a gas. Dark matter is 5 times the mass of regular matter, but primordial black holes are 50-500 times heavier than the average star, so they should be 10-100 times more sparse in elliptical galaxies and 1000 times more sparse in disk galaxies like ours. [Gravitational microlensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing) has been done with regular stars in our galaxy, and should therefore be possible with dark matter black holes in our galaxy.  In fact, that is precisely why we know dark matter black holes can't have most masses: too heavy, and we should have seen obvious lensing on occasion. Too light, and there should have been so many that we would have found themby studying specific areas of the sky intently.  The range we have left over is an annoying bit where the gravitational lensing is too small to derive from analysis over massed data, but too uncommon to find when looking intently. (Since the dark matter density is known, the number of black holes in a given volume is inversely related with the mass of each black hole, so they can't be too uncommon and small while still explaining dark matter).

I am only a physics undergrad and the examples I saw dealt with binary black hole/star systems, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I think the same concept can apply here.  Basically what they're looking at is the amount that the object bends light gravitationally, relative to it's partner object and based on their rotation around one another. So you see a combined bending from this binary system with more bending as the more massive object passes closer to us and less as the smaller one does, and this ratio can help to determine the black holes mass.

There are lots of interactions, so the momentum approaches an average value. The stars are relatively few in number and interact relatively weakly. Therefore, they tend to pass by each other with little change. Dark matter moving like stars indicates that if it is made of proton-sized particles, they would have to interact much more weakly. However, the observations don't rule out the possibility of the dark matter being black holes, which would behave like stars."

In clusters such as Abell 1689, lensing observations confirm the presence of considerably more mass than is indicated by the clusters' light. In the Bullet Cluster, lensing observations show that much of the lensing mass is separated from the X-ray-emitting baryonic mass. In July 2012, lensing observations were used to identify a ""filament"" of dark matter between two clusters of galaxies, as cosmological simulations predicted.[44]""  "

"4phmtm","Physicists suggest we might have just found dark matter while detecting gravitational waves.","d4m5a0f","tewas","OK, So i understand that stars are tiny and very spaced out relatively speaking and during the merger they don't really collide or anything. I'm completely fine with this. Black holes (the size we're talking about) probably have about the same radius of impact when they pass by (for the sake of the argument). What we see after the mergers in those pictures is blue shaded region that provides gravitational lensing where there is no observable matter (i hope i interpret this correctly). Now if black holes go thru the merger with little interaction since they small and space is big, wouldn't other stars also go thru the merger with little interaction and come out on the other side in the blue shaded area. So i would imagine we would have to see two galaxies where stars and black holes simply pass thru each other leaving gas clouds in actual collision that slows down the momentum. However if i'm right, those pictures doesn't show any stars in the blue shaded area, just more gravitational lensing than it should have based on known matter observations (visual, xray, ultraviolet, radio etc).   And this is my issue with the theory, if we have primordial black holes hanging around, when they clash, *some* of them will hit gas clouds and form accretion disks, that would act as mini quasar. i don't know if we could pick it up in the pictures, but it should be a big gamma ray source in the galaxy that doesn't fade quickly and it not size of the SMBH. "
"4phmtm","Physicists suggest we might have just found dark matter while detecting gravitational waves.","d4lmogn","tewas","No, the whole gist of the article is that if there is dark matter in every galaxy that keeps spinning speed as it is observed, and since we assume that it has very little to no interaction with normal matter, when there is galaxy collision (like a head on car) the normal matter, gas clouds and everything else interacts, there is a friction and speed of the matter in galaxies decreases. As the dark matter has little to no interaction with normal matter, it should simply fly away at it's normal speed. Think of the driver without seat belt that get's ejected. So if that is true, there should be higher gravitational lensing in either side of the colliding galaxies. That phenomena was observed and described in the article above. Now if we have black holes as that missing mass surrounding galaxy, when there is a collision, those black holes would become active (as they would interact with another galaxies gas) and we should expect to see lots of accretion disks at the beginning of the merger on either side. At least that's my line of thinking about this theory of primordial black holes. "

I'm not a particle physicist but my analysis of the situation is this: Based on this limit, some theories which propose expansions to the standard model of particle physics can be invalidated. This is because they propose new particles (WIMPS,etc) with unique interactions that would have needed cross sections higher than the observed cross section.

In 99% of cases, nothing will collide. They will speed past each other chaotically and the gravitational affects will send stars and planets spinning wildly past one another, which will take about 6 billion more years to settle and be considered a new singular galaxy. Many of these stars and planets will be flung out into space never to return.  In extremely rare cases, stars and planets will collide with one another.  Some parts of the galaxies will be generally unaffected, as the motions and gravitational effects will be so far away that they barely register.  However, consider the effect if a star with a larger mass than the sun were to speed past our solar system traveling millions of miles per hour.  The gravitational effect would be devastating, and likely would rip our solar system apart, sending our planets in different directions, and even jarring our sun off course and slinging it in a different direction.

"nnhcb5","New Dark Matter Map Shows The Bridges Between The Milky Way And Nearby Galaxies","gzw13zp","missle636","Actually quite the opposite, we think the dark matter 'bridges' precede the formation of galaxies, and this is really a crucial part of galaxy formation itself. It is required to explain how galaxies can form in a short enough timeframe that corresponds to reality.  During the early universe, regular matter actually had difficulties clumping together to form galaxies. The culprit: light. Light can provide pressure to regular matter (think of a light sail), and during the early universe, there was a lot more light than matter. This light slowed down the clumping of matter to form galaxies. This is where dark matter comes to the rescue: it does not interact with light and thus doesn't feel any light pressure. So while regular matter was having difficulties clumping together, dark matter clumped without resistance. When the dark matter clumps together, it forms regions of higher density in the form of these bridges. The highest densities of dark matter is where the bridges intersect. Despite the fact that regular matter was having difficulties clumping together by itself, it did feel the gravity from the dark matter. This gives a gravitational boost to the clumping of regular matter, with the strongest attraction to the intersection between the dark matter bridges. There the regular matter can then form galaxies, much quicker than it would without the dark matter being there."
"nnhcb5","New Dark Matter Map Shows The Bridges Between The Milky Way And Nearby Galaxies","gzvz4gn","N8CCRG","It's kind of the opposite.

It just doesn't seem terribly likely.   ""Dark forces"" would really be a better name for the phenomenon, something is pulling on matter in these regions. Generally the only force we know of that can do that is gravity, but that doesn't mean that this is *definitely* what's happening here, there cold be other explanations.  Personally, I wonder if what we're seeing is just the natural ""shape"" of this region of space. Given that no terrain on earth is perfectly uniform, there are hills, valleys, etc, and as the atmosphere isn't uniform, it has high pressure zones, low pressure zones, wind... so why do we assume space would be perfectly uniform? We tend to think of space as a perfect empty 3 dimensional grid, only warped or stretched by the matter that happens to occupy positions in the grid.  But if matter can stretch the fabric of space, then space *can* be stretched, and if space can be stretched, then why do we assume that it isn't already a little stretched out in some places?  Perhaps when we look at a map of dark matter in our region of space, what we're really seeing is a topographical map of our region of space - matter is attracted to 4 of these areas because that's where the natural ""valleys"" are, everything rolls downhill."

Why did they do this? Because they are nerds and they like number problems and that kind of thing.  Then people invented computers, and during that process, discovered that they're gonna need to tell the computer how to multiply a table of numbers by another table of numbers. Fortunately by this point, those nerdy mathematicians had already sorted out this problem and had come up with some damn efficient ways of doing it.

"nnhcb5","New Dark Matter Map Shows The Bridges Between The Milky Way And Nearby Galaxies","gzv910k","Deleted","According to Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, gravity warps spacetime like a funhouse mirror, and the more mass (and subsequently gravity) there is in an area, the more spacetime is warped. When light comes from behind a truly massive object, it bends and warps like a lens, [as can be seen in this image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/A_Horseshoe_Einstein_Ring_from_Hubble.JPG) and [this diagram](http://www.roe.ac.uk/~heymans/website_images/Gravitational-lensing-galaxyApril12_2010-1024x768.jpg). This is called **gravitational lensing**.  We can measure the *amount* of warping around an object, and then through other means measure the amount of visible “normal” matter in that object, and the end results don’t match up.  The warping says there is *more matter* there than the count of visible “normal” objects says. Several other entirely separate methods of measuring mass also don’t match up in the same way (such as the speed of galactic rotation vs how much visible mass there is in the galaxy, and also the movements of galaxies toward and around each other). So, **there is a discrepancy between how much gravity there _is_ and how much mass we can actually _see_** in the universe.  From this discrepancy, scientists reasoned that there must be  *something* that is 1) transparent in the visible spectrum when looking at it through our telescopes (either it’s really small like fine dust or gas, or it is truly invisible to light), and 2) exists in such large quantities that it’s about 4 times more massive than all the “normal” matter in the observable universe combined. They don’t know what it is, so they called it “**dark matter**”."
"nnhcb5","New Dark Matter Map Shows The Bridges Between The Milky Way And Nearby Galaxies","gzv9w7j","Maezel","Gravity is just curvature of space time. Spacetime gets curved when there is matter sitting somewhere. Enough matter can bend light of sources that sit behind it. The more matter, the more it bends. This is gravitational lensing.   We observed light bending, and we know how much it should bend given the matter that sits between the emitter and us. However, the matter we see is not enough to produce the bending we observe. Moreover, the matter we see is not enough to keep galaxies together in clusters or even stars in certain galaxies. Therefore, there must be something else out there that is curving Spacetime, keeping things together and bending light when they shouldn't, but we can't observe it and doesn't interact with electromagnetism. That something is dark matter, and as of today we have no idea what it is, even if it accounts for around 20% of the total energy of the universe (with 5% being what we observe and the rest dark energy)"
"nnhcb5","New Dark Matter Map Shows The Bridges Between The Milky Way And Nearby Galaxies","gzvdbgt","CromulentInPDX","When light passes around am object that creates significant curvature, it travels in multiple paths, which means we can see multiple images of it.

Depending on its distribution (I'm over 10 years out of academia, so I'm not up to date on the latest measurements) it could be passing through you all the time, similar to neutrinos.  There's no reason to say dark matter doesn't exist. It just doesn't interact via the electromagnetic force. It clearly (from observations) exerts a gravitational interaction. WIMPS, long sought after lightest supersymmetric particles, are the primary guess as to what it consists of. Originally, they were thought to only interact via the weak force and gravity. Since being out of academia, it sea that that assumption has changed.  Dark matter, and dark energy for that matter, are some of the biggest open questions in physics. Our effective theories hold up very well for most observations in space and in accelerators, so it's reasonable to assume we're on the right track. However, we clearly observe gravitational interactions from something we can't see, which is why it's called dark matter.

The crazy thing is, we’re seeing light that would have never reached us that is now being bent toward us. Picture it like this: stand in front of a basketball (say this is at eye level, suspended maybe), and put a baseball directly behind it so you can’t see it while looking forward at the basketball. Now, picture the baseball glowing brightly. Under normal circumstances (no lensing), we still can’t see the baseball- the basketball blocks all the light we would see from it, and all the other rays are scattering in the other directions. Now, WITH lensing, we could literally see a warped version of the baseball around the edges of the basketball- it’s not that the light can suddenly pass through the basketball, but the basketball is warping space time so much that it’s pulling in some of the rays that would have otherwise scattered elsewhere. It’s curving some of the light that wouldn’t have hit us to the point where now we can partially see an object fully behind another object. Does that kind of make sense?"

Predictions have been confirmed over and over.   Light is not what is being bent, it's space. Same amount of matter will bend space in the same way as long as the centre of gravity is located in the same place. The only moment where density becomes important is when the object reaches the critical threshold for it to become a blackhole. In that case, the curvature of space would be so big within the event horizon that light will just fall in, but outside the event horizon gravitational lensing will occur as usual.  Objects curve space far beyond their actual size (hence planets orbiting stars). If you want to be pedantic, every object in the universe curves space all the way to infinity. Think of it as a blanket suspended between 4 chairs where you put a ball in the centre. That's what happens, but in 3D rather than 2d."

"nnhcb5","New Dark Matter Map Shows The Bridges Between The Milky Way And Nearby Galaxies","gzy455r","Lewri","Well when we're working with dark matter observations and mapping the universe, it's more typically weak lensing observations. Weak lensing is when the lensing effect is small enough that it's not noticeable, you could not easily differentiate between an elliptical galaxy and a circular galaxy that's been distorted into an ellipse by a lens.  With weak lenses, we instead have to look for how such ellipticities may all be aligned in a specific way in a patch of sky, suggesting the ellipticities to then be extrinsic rather than intrinsic. From how strongly they are ""sheared"" (made elliptical) in various places, we can then determine the mass and distribution of the lens.  As for strong lenses, the image can be reconstructed in various ways using analysis methods such as sparse optimisation."

The opposite of lensing would be just appear to be scattering, so there would just a blurry patch of space to look at. However, this wouldn't tell us anything much, we couldn't distinguish this from regular matter that does this all the time.  This is the rub with dark matter. It is meant to be 80% of all matter, be in and around everything, and dominate the baryonic matter that is everything you see and know. It does all and is everywhere... and we can't find it.

Dyson spheres are excluded by microlensing just as almost all other massive compact halo objects are (MACHOs for short). Microlensing looks for small increases of brightness of background stars as a heavy object passes between us and it. The brightness increase is caused by gravitational lensing. A Dyson sphere would still have approximately the same mass even if all of the star's matter had been converted into something useful and would still cause the same lensing.  Also in very small dwarf galaxies the mass discrepancy (or dark:normal ratio if you want) is easily of the order \~100. So for every visible star there would have to be 100 Dyson spheres. And that is true for all dwarf galaxies (and larger low surface brightness galaxies which are equally diffuse). So that would mean that somehow aliens did that to all the dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way but then said never mind to the Milky Way itself. Doesn't seem reasonable to me. Also it's never aliens.\^  ^(Until ^suddenly ^it ^is ^aliens ^and ^we'll ^be ^too ^late ^to ^act. ^But ^really ^this ^is ^not ^aliens.)"

Also, it would be really weird for only _some_ of the stars in a galaxy to be Dysoned. We would expect that once a Dyson-level civilization emerged in a galaxy, they would Dyson up every star in a few million years.

As the timescale is less than a second, the pendulum will move by *less* than 10^(-21) meters.  Once in a while particles should be slower. We expect something like 1 in 1000 particles to have only 20 km/s relative velocity, then we get ~10^(-21) meters displacement. That's still three orders of magnitude below the sensitivity of LIGO. Sure, we get a few thousand excited pendulums, and many of them will have the particle getting closer than ~1 cm, so maybe we can gain two or even three orders of magnitude here. That's still LIGO-level precision but for a billion mirrors."

Not because modified gravity arguments and evidence are less convincing. You can't publish if your modified equations don't work. But if your dark matter detector doesn't show any dark matter you can publish that you've excluded a particular candidate. Getting grants for advanced scientific equipment with spin off technologies is easier than getting grants for just sitting and thinking real hard for a decade with probably little to show for it. Most theories are going to be wrong just as most particle candidates are going to be wrong.  There is a reason Einstein had to work in a patent office.  > So far trying to find new equations has been a total disaster  Nonsense. Milgrom's equations are excellent for calculating the exact baryonic mass from its motion before you observe it and vice versa. That can't even be done from a dark matter perspective. You need both the normal mass and its motion to infer the precise amount of dark matter. Without that the best that can be done is give a wide statistical ball park. And even that fails regularly.  Particularly spectacular are dwarf galaxies very near a parent galaxy. Two dwarf galaxies that are identical in mass distribution and morphology will have the same ballpark expectation from dark matter regardless of their distance to a parent galaxy (because of the strong equivalence principle of GR). This is not at all what we observe though. Dwarf galaxies very near their parents rotate an order of magnitude slower than when far away. This is exactly as expected by the external field effect of Milgrom's equations.   In order to do the same with dark matter you first have to invent some dark matter particle which haven't been proven to exist. Then you have to invent some mechanism why in some specific galaxies the dark matter suddenly isn't there. And you have to do so in a way that doesn't rely on baryonic feedback mechanisms because the galaxies are identical in terms of baryons. (Can't be done, so it's just ignored.)  And all of that is just for dynamics of single galaxies. Milgrom's equations also explain why the Milky Way, Andromeda and Centaurus A have very thin planes of satellite galaxies. Dark matter can't do that because it would cause dynamical friction and all the satellites would merge with the host.  > whereas we get more and more evidence for there being something actually there that we can't see.  No. All of the dark matter experiments to find new particles have been a failure. No new particles have been found.  We get more evidence for *mass discrepancies*. Situations where our observations don't match what Newton/GR tell us should happen. That means *either* the equations are wrong *or* there is more stuff out there. We can't tell which it is unless someone invents new equations that replace GR in its entirety or someone detects dark matter particles. Until that time this remains an open problem in physics."

But the concept of a Dyson galaxy is a logical extension of known physics and our own behavior. If there are civilizations that emerged before us anywhere nearby, we would expect to see them.

It’s a question of exponential growth. One star grows and colonizes their neighbors. Then each of those colonizes their neighbors. And so on. As long as the species keeps growing (which you would kind of expect if they evolved through natural selection), then we’d expect one Dyson swarm to turn into a whole galaxy’s worth pretty quickly.  And the problem with cultural explanations for why we don’t see this, is that it works well enough to explain _one_ species, but it has to explain _all_ of them. Either there aren’t any alien civilizations in the next billion light years, or there needs to be a reason that _all_ of them are non-expansionist.  Imagine if it was us. A few hundred years from now we have the technology to build Dyson swarms and reliable interstellar colony ships. Both plausible under known physics.

Neutrinos are an already known example of particles like this, but neutrinos aren't ""heavy"" enough to fully explain the amount of mass being detected out there.  Here's a Wikipedia excerpt of why neutrinos don't ""reflect light or anything"" - remember light is electromagnetic radiation:  > Neutrinos do not carry electric charge, which means that they are not affected by the electromagnetic forces that act on charged particles such as electrons and protons. Neutrinos are affected only by the weak sub-atomic force, of much shorter range than electromagnetism, and gravity, which is relatively weak on the subatomic scale. They are therefore able to travel great distances through matter without being affected by it.  And things like the Bullet Cluster suggest that dark matter similarly travels through normal matter without being greatly affected by it.  I don't think it's yet known whether ""Dark matter"" is a bunch of particles like neutrinos except heavier, but we can detect more mass than is accounted for by the stuff interacting electromagnetically, and weakly interacting particles fit the behaviour of that mass and explain everything nicely but by their nature will be difficult to detect.

So they searched for them using microlensing techniques, and unfortunately, they just didn't find enough.  Next, we have the cosmic microwave background, which gives us a record of the temperature fluctuations in the early universe, when it's way too hot for any planets or stars or anything to form. Dark matter would have an effect on these fluctuations, because it adds to gravity without adding for pressure. And yes, it looks like dark matter is there even before we have a chance for structure to form.

"w1i3w","Dark Matter Filament Directly Observed for the First Time","c59ohf6","Astrokiwi","Uhh kinda but I think you're getting confused.  *All* matter - both normal baryonic matter and dark matter - started as a fairly homogenous soup. This was a very hot and dense soup - so dense that light could not go very far in the universe. Because there was so much stuff, gravity was trying to make everything collapse into clumps. However, the immense pressure produced by the immense heat pushes everything back again and smooths thing out. As a result, the early universe is a big mess of wibbly-wobbly-gassy-wassy stuff. Some bits of the universe are a little denser than others (in both gas and dark matter), but it all bounces back fairly quickly.  Now, as the universe expands, it cools and gets less dense. Firstly, this means that the gas in the universe becomes thin enough for light to pass through again. This happens quite quickly, so what happens is we get a big chunk of radiation that is emitted just before the universe becomes transparent, and this radiation is free to travel basically forever. **This** is the cosmic microwave background radiation. We can use this radiation to measure the very small changes in density and temperature in the early universe.  Next, as the universe is cooler, it doesn't have the pressure to support itself against the gravity of all this gas and dark matter. So the bits that were slightly denser get denser and denser. Over time, it (both gas and dark matter) collapses into pancakes and filaments.  So the small changes in density which you can discover by investigating the cosmic microwave background are the small ""seeds"" of density change that are magnified into the strong structures of galaxies, filaments and pancakes."

We've looked, and there's no chocolate.)  > Could it be some sort of a new type of matter that we haven't seen before?   The best theory so far is that it is a new type of *particle* that we have not seen before. One that does not interact through the electromagnetic or strong nuclear force. This is not exactly an entirely new type of matter, as we know of at least one such particle already: the neutrino. The problem with the neutrino is that even though there is a ridiculously huge number of them flying around, their mass is tiny, and they alone wouldn't be enough for them to be dark matter.  Several experiments are running trying to detect particles which are like neutrinos, but heavier. The results so far are inconclusive.

Chocolate happens to be one of them. (Chocolate, like all other regular matter, interacts electromagnetically, which means the background radiation of the universe will heat it up, which will make it glow weakly in the far infrared, and thus it can be seen even when floating around in deep space. We've looked, and there's no chocolate.)  Ahh interesting, that part I (obviously) didn't know.  Thanks!  > The best theory so far is that it is a new type of particle that we have not seen before. One that does not interact through the electromagnetic or strong nuclear force. This is not exactly an entirely new type of matter, as we know of at least one such particle already: the neutrino. The problem with the neutrino is that even though there is a ridiculously huge number of them flying around, their mass is tiny, and they alone wouldn't be enough for them to be dark matter. Several experiments are running trying to detect particles which are like neutrinos, but heavier. The results so far are inconclusive. Some report maybe seeing a very weak signal, but there is not enough data to tell yet.  Crazy..  So basically it's an entire new type of *something* that's out there..  What about the hypothesis that it's regular matter but that part of the Universe (where it is) being slightly different from ours, with slightly different rules?

Modified gravity theories, specifically those that are related to MOND or TeVeS, have nothing to offer.  MOND is curve fitting. Literally. Its' tunable parameters have no basis in reality, and its' relativistic generalization TeVeS has managed to explain exactly fuck-all. It can't get the CMBR peaks (or much of anything else in the CMB) correct, nor can it make a serious attempt at much of anything else. Folks like Beckenstein and McGauch might like it, but nobody really takes it seriously because of its' above failings.  >They are serious contentions and important to consider in order to keep people thinking about this problem.  Sure, if you are from 10+ years ago. Unfortunately for such theories, higher resolution examinations of the CMB and discoveries such as the bullet cluster (and other fun relations from weak lensing) have rather decisively made such theories uninteresting.  > [...] there's no particular reason that they have to be the wrong ones.   Other than the observational falsifications and the fundamental fact that the theories merely push back the question of 'what is dark matter' back another step. If the goal is to have a phenominalogical overview of the stuff, then our existing theories are more than sufficient. If you want an explanation that goes beyond that, tough titties - MOND, et al, don't cover it.  On a more technical note, the favorite contender TeVeS, is built upon the exact same Lagrangian as general relativity but with an extra four-vector and scalar field on top of the mix. There isn't really much constraining the extra fields so what you really have is the freedom of general relativity plus two whole additional fields that don't have any real coupling to reality.  Eeeexxxceeeppttt there's [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1450)  The tl;dr of that is that the TeVeS parameter space got shoved through a wood chipper. Stupid fucking theory. Can its' proponents shut the hell up and do useful science again? If not I will make a NEW theory that adds an additional arbitrary tensor field to the mix and proclaim victory because at that point the only thing that'll work is ridicule.  > Dark matter could well turn out to be this scientific generation's ether for all we know.

No.  You're really confused.

This nuclear recoil is then measured/converted into something measurable (like heat or light) by a very sensitive detector. There are several experiments, and there is always refinement going on; one of my favourite ones is CRESST, if you want to look one up. One of the major challenges, as usual in this field, is the reduction and identification of background - for example, apart from setting the detector up deeply underground, they use lead from sunken Roman ships for shielding, since over the long years of lying at the bottom of the mediterranean see the radioactive elements in there have decayed and little have been activated by radiation. They need to build other important parts of the detector out of radio-pure materials, too, down to the screws they use."

You could talk about splitting things up in matter and energy, like in Einsteins equation E=mc^2, but all that equation really says is that matter and energy are two sides of the same coin.  In particle physics there is a clear distinction between what is called matter, which consists of quarks, leptons and neutrinos, and force mediators like photons (for example light), gluons which 'glues' atom nuclei together and weak force mediators, called W and Z particles, which is responsible for stuff like nuclear radiation.  It is hypothesized that dark matter is a new particle belonging to the matter category, along with the quarks, leptons and neutrinos. What it is exactly is the big mystery. We can only see it effects because of how it effects gravity."

Another example: Had one found Neutrinos to be massless (which we now know they aren't, but a few years back that was still debated), then that would have been a perfect example for massless matter.

Their structure is like arms with a shoulder and an inverted elbow reaching out to connect to another elbow and shoulder across the canyon. The arms are fused laterally to form flat surfaces and rail & socket joints. Powerful muscles and glands lie within the cliffs and valley, churning and digesting fat rolls to create a translucent proteilagenous gel which completely fills the canyons and rises up two hundred feet above the plane, making for a honeycomb appearance. Fat rolls at the edges get backed up and sometimes decay into a soil-like substance. The cliffs pull away from the gel wall to suck down fat rolls toward the bottom, but some get pushed into the gel, which is sparsely speckled."

[Physics forum:](http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=364179) The short answer is that it is very unlikely that black holes constitute a significant portion of dark matter. Observations of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and the observed chemical abundances show that there needs to be a large amount of non-baryonic matter in the universe.  [Physics forum again:](http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=364179) The thing about blackholes is that they are very visible. They are surrounded by an accretion disc of infalling matter that radiates characteristically in the X-ray band. We don't see this, thus no unaccounted-for BHs.  My appeal to intuition: black holes can collide, and their collisions are violent, additive events that create gravitational waves and a larger black hole. They're clumpy. Dark matter, on the other hand, doesn't clump because it has no (electromagnetic) mechanism with which to interact with anything else. So the scenario I think you're asking about in which dark matter is replaced with multitudes of infinitesimally small black holes couldn't be stable enough to produce consistent lensing effects."

Of course, it is true that the only thing we know of that causes a gravitational field is mass... so this is the most probable thing we can think of.  Nevertheless, we are dealing with the unknown and unexplored territory here.  Its important to keep an open mind and entertain the possibility that this may be due to some sort of other effect in empty space that we are unaware of.    Its sort of like, if you went back 100 years, someone might make the observation that every flying animal and object they see has wings.  It would be pretty easy to say that wings are required to fly... but then 30 years later or so we'd have rockets that would disprove this notion.  The truth is that we see a gravitational disturbance, and we have no idea what it is precisely.  Putting any sort of label on it is disingenuous IMO.

People, spaceships, planets, etc. count as regular stuff. Not so sure about black holes themselves.  There's no good way to visualize what happens inside a black hole, because nothing about the mechanics of it is relatable to human experience. We can think of external interactions involving black holes, objects approaching event horizons, and so on with classical notions of position and time, but that all breaks down once inside.  The gist: the ""proper time"" it takes for spaghettification, cooking, or whatever particular aspect of death by black hole you prefer to think kills you first is finite. For a supermassive black hole, it might be a few hours before you hit the singularity. You're long dead by then anyway.   Someone's written a [short paper](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0705/0705.1029v1.pdf) on the use of rockets to maximize survival time below the event horizon, but no matter what you do, you're obliterated in a finite amount of time.  What you're probably thinking of is what an outside observer sees. Provided the external observer is far enough away, they see the object being sucked into the black hole *appear* to slow down to a standstill, never reaching the singularity, but that's just optical trickery. I won't risk mangling any calculations, but if the observer is at a reasonable distance from the event and the black hole isn't particularly large, chances are the black hole's victim hits the singularity before the observer can even see the victim passing under the event horizon.

The concept feels a bit too ad hoc, to be an invention to patch up some flaw of the theory because people cannot let go of General Relativity. But consider these two points:  * Historically, this is not without precedence. The neutrino, for example, was inferred from missing energy-momentum in scattering experiments. One could have said ""Why should there be neutrinos? You physicists just invented these invisible mysterious particles, because you are just too arrogant to let go of energy and momentum conservation!"" Of course, neutrinos *do* exist, and energy-momentum conservation in scattering experiments is a really cool thing to have, so we'd better keep it! Also General Relativity rests on some very few natural assumptions, and it seems understandable that people want to conserve these.  * That said, respectable people actually *do* try to alter General Relativity. As I tried to tell in my last comment, this is pretty much an open game, anybody can play. If you can write down a ""generalization of General Relativity"" that explains everything that dark matter is needed for right now, without the need to add additional matter degrees of freedom, then that's brilliant! Everyone would accept that. The point is that nobody has found such a generalization yet. There are some versions (like [TeVeS Gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor–vector–scalar_gravity), some forms of [f(R) gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\(R\)_gravity), or relaxing the condition of vanishing [torsion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein–Cartan_theory)). But each of these explains at most the anomalous rotation curves of galaxies (sometimes with heavy fine-tuning, which in my opinion is much worse than an invention of a new type of matter), but none of the many other occasions of ""there being more gravity that matter"". See for instance the [structure formation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_formation) of the universe, or the [bullet cluster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_cluster).

Again, you have the gravitational lensing contributing to anisotropy in the CMB... but then some people would say that there is less than expected and that this is evidence for dark energy.    Again, no one really has any evidence to suggest WHAT is causing this.  Simplistic thinking seems to prevail.  Some people made an alternative theory of gravity that was not very good, and it has been disproven several times.

It exactly matches what we'd expect if you smashed two big gassy blobs together and there was dark matter.  Well, lets be honest here... we are making pretty big assumptions about the masses of the galaxies, how much of it is baryonic, and how much of the hot gas was left behind during the collision.  These assumptions themselves are very tenuous, and they directly effect our conclusions.  All of that aside though, we see that most of the lensing occurs around the galaxies. Ok, this does actually relate to the fact that galactic discs seem to exhibit higher levels of gravitation than we could account for.    In other words, its just more unexplained gravity where we didn't expect it.  While it certainly doesn't harm the dark matter hypothesis, calling this a ""smoking gun"" is sort of a joke.  Ok, it gives some MOND theories trouble... so what?  At the end of the day, what does this really show?  Unexplained gravity... the same unexplained gravity we sought out to explain when we came up with the  theory for dark matter.  Even using this as evidence is borderline circular reasoning.  >The core part of ""dark matter"" is that we've described what we can. 1) There seems to be something with mass there. 2) It doesn't give off enough light to detect. 3) It appears to interact very weakly, if at all, with normal matter (by normal I mean the stuff we already know about).  This is sort of what I'm criticizing... because you are jumping to conclusions.  You have extra gravity.  You assume its extra mass, but we don't know that.  The MOND theory was an attempt at a theory without extra mass, and most people agree that it was unlikely... but its an example of an idea that doesn't involve mass.  You can say that DM doesn't interact with normal matter, and it doesn't emit or reflect light, IF it exists.... but again this isn't saying much.  We've only been able to describe what it is not.  What I'm getting at is that you are describing something in which you cannot assert (with evidence) a single quality.    >Both seem to match in terms of behaviour, why posit that there are two unexplained phenomena that appear to behave in the same way?  Well increased gravity will cause a greater degree of lensing... obviously this is true.  Its not a crazy notion to assume that lensing = more gravity, but we can't claim its a tautology.  Do we really know that this is true in each case of gravitational lensing?     Considering the universe is being forced apart by some unknown mechanism, do we really know that the process is even everywhere?  Are there bubbles, ripples, etc?  This is just coming out of imagination, but I think its important to take a step back and evaluate what you really know.    The truth is, if 95% of the universe IS dark energy and dark matter... we know next to nothing about the universe! So.. if we are right about expansion and dark matter, we have a long way to go.

Sure, you can use it to claim that something is there, but its just invisible and intangible... I've heard a lot of creationism arguments like that too.  I have nothing to prove that you are wrong, but I have to reiterate ""the evidence"" you are claiming only shows additional gravity.  That is why we invented the concept of dark matter - there was more gravity than we could account for with traditional models.    Its sort of like asking ""why do trees grow""... and I answered ""well obviously, god is doing it.  Look, they even grow up towards heaven, just as I'd expect"".  If you ask me for evidence, I'd just say ""well, look at all these trees growing, how do you explain that?"". I'm sure a few conversations went like that 2000 years ago, before we were able to comprehend what exactly was happening.   >No, but assuming it's different make far less sense. See Occams Razor for more information on the subject.  You can't really invoke that here.  In fact, it works in my favor more than it does yours.  We are analyzing how much we really know and whether we can make assumptions.  I'm arguing in favor of making less assumptions about the universe when our observations are so limited.  Occams Razor favors less assumptions.  Assuming *all* similar looking events are caused by the same thing is more likely to be wrong than right.    >But these are qualities. Not emitting or reflecting light is saying a lot about its properties. We can talk about how it must interact with things (e.g. how the bullet cluster masses have formed after the collision) as well.  They are qualities only if you can show it actually exists.  As of right now, its just an absence of evidence.  You'd expect to see something there, but you don't.  Honestly, if you are going to use the occam's razor argument, I think you can see how assuming there is an invisible and intangible form of matter might not mesh with the idea of making fewer assumptions.    Again though, I'm not really saying the DM theory is wrong.  I'm only saying there seems to be quite a bit of bias towards the idea, almost like its a ""case closed"" type of deal.... and its completely unwarranted.

Image courtesy STScI, U. Arizona, CfA, CXC, NASA   Ker Than for National Geographic News  Published August 31, 2011  **The mysterious substance known as dark matter may actually be an illusion created by gravitational interactions between short-lived particles of matter and antimatter, a new study says. **  Dark matter is thought to be an invisible substance that makes up almost a quarter of the mass in the universe. The concept was first proposed in 1933 to explain why the outer galaxies in galaxy clusters orbit faster than they should, based on the galaxies' visible mass.  At the observed speeds, the outer galaxies should be flung out into space, since the clusters don't appear to have enough mass to keep the galaxies at their edges gravitationally bound.  So physicists proposed that the galaxies are surrounded by halos of invisible matter. This dark matter provides the extra mass, which in turn creates gravitational fields strong enough to hold the clusters together.  In the new study, physicist Dragan Hajdukovic at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland proposes an alternative explanation, based on something he calls the ""gravitational polarization of the quantum vacuum.""  **Empty Space Filled With ""Virtual"" Particles**  The quantum vacuum is the name physicists give to what we see as empty space.  According to quantum physics, empty space is not actually barren but is a boiling sea of so-called virtual particles and antiparticles constantly popping in and out of existence.  Antimatter particles are mirror opposites of normal matter particles. For example, an antiproton is a negatively charged version of the positively charged proton, one of the basic constituents of the atom.  When matter and antimatter collide, they annihilate in a flash of energy. The virtual particles spontaneously created in the quantum vacuum appear and then disappear so quickly that they can't be directly observed.  In his new mathematical model, Hajdukovic investigates what would happen if virtual matter and virtual antimatter were not only electrical opposites but also gravitational opposites—an idea some physicists previously proposed.  ""Mainstream physics assumes that there is only one gravitational charge, while I have assumed that there are two gravitational charges,"" Hajdukovic said.  According to his idea, outlined in the current issue of the journal Astrophysics and Space Science, matter has a positive gravitational charge and antimatter a negative one.  That would mean matter and antimatter are gravitationally repulsive, so that an object made of antimatter would ""fall up"" in the gravitational field of Earth, which is composed of normal matter.  Particles and antiparticles could still collide, however, since gravitational repulsion is much weaker than electrical attraction.  **How Galaxies Could Get Gravity Boost**  While the idea of particle antigravity might seem exotic, Hajdukovic says his theory is based on well-established tenants in quantum physics.  For example, it's long been known that particles can team up to create a so-called electric dipole, with positively charge particles at one end and negatively charged particles at the other.  According to theory, there are countless electric dipoles created by virtual particles in any given volume of the quantum vacuum.  All of these electric dipoles are randomly oriented—like countless compass needles pointing every which way. But if the dipoles form in the presence of an existing electric field, they immediately align along the same direction as the field.  According to quantum field theory, this sudden snapping to order of electric dipoles, called polarization, generates a secondary electric field that combines with and strengthens the first field.  Hajdukovic suggests that a similar phenomenon happens with gravity. If virtual matter and antimatter particles have different gravitational charges, then randomly oriented gravitational dipoles would be generated in space.  If these gravitational dipoles form near a galaxy—a massive object that would have a strong gravitational field—the dipoles should become polarized.  This polarization would generate a secondary gravitational field that would combine with and strengthen the galaxy's gravitational field.  ""My theory makes the gravitational field of a galaxy stronger—without dark matter,"" Hajdukovic said.  **Evidence for Dark Matter ""Very Compelling""**  Physicist David Evans called the new study a ""very interesting theoretical exercise,"" but he said he isn't ready to abandon dark matter just yet.  ""The evidence for dark matter is now very compelling,"" said Evans, of the University of Birmingham, who leads the U.K. team for the ALICE detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.  For example, in 2006 astronomers unveiled a photo of two colliding galaxies known as the Bullet cluster that purportedly showed the separation of matter from dark matter.  A similar effect was observed in the Pandora cluster earlier this summer, said Evans, who was not involved in the study.   Hajdukovic said he is currently expanding his theory to account for these observations. His preliminary calculations, he said, suggest that ""what is observed in the Bullet cluster and more recently at the Pandora cluster may be understood in the framework of the gravitational polarization of the quantum vacuum.""  CERN physicist Michael Doser agreed that Hajdukovic's ideas are ""unorthodox"" but did not immediately dismiss the new theory.  ""The mainstream view suffers from the lack of a detected dark matter particle, and so exploring a wide range of possibilities is at this moment perfectly legitimate, as long as they are compatible with all data,"" Doser said in an email.  Doser is a member of CERN's AEgIS experiment, which aims to measure the gravitational charge of antihydrogen, the antimatter version of hydrogen, and thus would prove whether matter and antimatter are gravitationally repulsive.  ""In a few years,"" Doser said, ""we should definitely be in a position to confirm or refute [Hajdukovic's] hypothesis.""  "

Wrong in the sense that we're assuming matter on a galactic scale obeys the laws of classical physics.  Quantum mechanics came about because classical mechanics doesn't and can't apply to the sub-atomic world. And *maybe* classical mechanics also doesn't and can't apply to the ""galactic-scale"" world. Maybe systems with such vast mass and distance such as galaxies and milky ways obey a different form of mechanics no one has thought of yet.  Is that such an outlandish idea? I must add I don't study astrophysics so I'm not entirely clued up on how people calculate galaxy movements, but I'm guessing they do use classical mechanics to work it out."

In the center of mass frame, the colliding antiparticles have no net momentum, whereas a single photon always has momentum (since it is determined, as we have seen, only by the photon's frequency or wavelength—which cannot be zero). Hence, conservation of momentum (or equivalently, translational invariance) requires that at least two photons are created, with zero net momentum. (However, it is possible if the system interacts with another particle or field for annihilation to produce one photon, as when a positron annihilates with a bound atomic electron, it is possible for only one photon to be emitted, as the nuclear Coulomb field breaks translational symmetry.) The energy of the two photons, or, equivalently, their frequency, may be determined from conservation of four-momentum. Seen another way, the photon can be considered as its own antiparticle  in other words: the photon has no mass and no charge, photons must therefore come in pairs, with no charge and that makes them their own antiparticle  (the edit was a missing N in photon)"

Wait, where am I going with this, oh yeah. Wouldn't Dark Matter clump around the center of a galaxy, and therefore cause more mass to be near the center of a galaxy and cause the same rotational problems? I mean, I know next to nothing about it aside from ""It attracts"" Now, if there's an explanation for why it's just attracted to itself enough so as to cause the steady rotation, then that would imply an extremely fine tuned system wouldn't it? The variables involved would have to so precise it'd be almost impossible. Why does it not make sense that perhaps gravity works differently at large distances and the gravitational lensing we see from objects like the bullet cluster isn't just something new in deep space that we haven't observed.

Of course, there are several generations of scalar field theories now in play, many removing three Big Things - the Big Bang singularity (replacing it with a finite sized bounce), the cosmological constant and dark matter.

EG [here is a recent one](http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.6052)   The problem is that all of them sound interesting, all of them (now) have consistent mathematics - so far as I can judge! - and not one of them offers a path to evidence.

"k1hdm","Dark Matter May Be an Illusion","c2gv8dq","char0n","I too come from baltimoresports perspective (physics fanboy, but by no means an expert), and I once echoed his sentiments due to the fact that often the explanation of ""Dark Matter"" given to the layman sounds almost like a ""God did it"" cop-out: ""Our rules of physics (which must be right) get things totally wrong when we hit these cases (which we do often), so we're just adding the dark matter variable to our equations, which itself has no known solution but always equals the amount we were off by"".  This is what I'm pretty sure he meant by it being an easy out, rather than ""that's boring, make me a better one!""  On my end I ended up doing some research (read: used google) and found plausible explanations of what this matter may be composed of in order to be undetectable and how it happens not just to be the simplest but the best solution to a lot of specific cases, but just going on what I was told by common ""layman's"" explanations, it did sound like ""Calculation wasn't right? dark matter!""

"k1hdm","Dark Matter May Be an Illusion","c2gttw1","Deleted","I understand his point.  Some sort of mass or force exists.  Dark Matter was theorized to fit the physics models and formulas with that observation.  If this Antigravity Theory can also fit just as well with the data/observations, then it does call in to question the legitimacy of Dark Matter's existence.  More tools can be built and data collected.  Another theory may emerge at some point too.  That's the beauty of Science!"
"k1hdm","Dark Matter May Be an Illusion","c2gu0be","calinet6","But basically, he's got a damn good point—we have some explanation that fits the data, but we don't know what it is or if it's founded in reality whatsoever. That's an interesting problem.  ""Dark Matter"" is just the name for the part of the data we can't explain. It's an empty puzzle piece that we can't find that we've given a name. *We still want to find that missing piece.*  It is exactly this kind of doubt and dissatisfaction with the status quo and with incomplete theories and vague explanations which drives science forward. No one is asking for science fiction—he's just asking for a better explanation than ""Well, we don't really know where it comes from, what it is, or fully how it works."" Seems like a perfectly valid thing to doubt. And Doubt and uncertainty and dissatisfaction with any given explanation are things to be cherished, and never mocked.  > We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress, we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty—some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain. Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don’t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question—to doubt—to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained. > > \- Richard Feynman "

It reminds me when astronomers made these insanely crazy multi-loop oribits of the planets to avoid the the fact that we shared a rotation around the sun and keep the Ptolemaic/Geocentric universe. The observations were correct but the theory was forced. All the answers where right there and some very smart people knew it but a large majority didn't want to change their accepted view.

(note: I don't believe we're all simulated, but thinking about this has made me realise I can never be sure and it doesn't matter anyway)  Firstly, you have to concede that if it's possible to create a simulation of life that is in some way ""self aware"", the life that is being simulated can have no way of determining that it is merely a simulation unless it is given that information (or access to it) by whoever created it. Realising this, it's then essentially impossible to absolutely rule out the notion that we may be a simulation.  Secondly, the most intelligent life we thusfar know of (humans) are creating increasingly sophisticated simulations of life, the universe, and every facet of existence. If our species continues to prosper or even exist, we will eventually, at some point, create a simulation of a universe so complex and detailed that it will resemble our own.  In summation:  * If it is possible or ever will be possible to simulate life, the simulation will most likely be unable to detect it as such.  * We are already creating simulations of life and will eventually create simulations of universes similar to our own.  Combined, this information means eventually there will be a simulation of a universe as rich as ours, that, to its inhabitants, is their entire reality. How can we know for certain that it isn't already us? There could even be an Inception thing going on, where we're inside a simulation of a simulation of a simulation etc...

"k1hdm","Dark Matter May Be an Illusion","c2guq0b","spartanKid","We're able to measure the effects and properties of dark energy by looking at the expansion of the Universe and using standard candles like Type 1A supernovae.   Unless matter is spontaneously changing from regular matter, to ""dark matter"" to ""dark energy"" then the total densities of regular matter and the rest are fixed from the origin of the Universe.   Since dark matter and dark energy don't appear to interact through the forces we know and love to allow changes (E&M, Weak, Strong), then according to the physics we currently know, there is no way to create dark energy from regular matter.  As the Universe expands, the volume of the Universe increases, but the relatively density of composition of the Universe remains the same.   The effects of dark energy appear to be getting stronger as the Universe expands, so that's why it's peculiar. The effects of all of the other forces and things in the Universe tend to weaken as they're diluted. "

"k1hdm","Dark Matter May Be an Illusion","c2gzffm","spartanKid","Dark matter does tend to clump around heavy objects but it doesn't condense or fall in towards the center of galaxies like you think.  Dark matter is very bad at exchanging angular momentum or energy because it can't interact through the E&M force. Regular matter, when gravitationally attracted and in-falling into a potential, can gain or absorb photons to exchange energy. When particles of mater start condensing to form galaxies they release a lot of gravitational potential energy as Photons, thus allowing them to come closer and closer together while still conserving momentum and energy.  Dark matter can't do this, so in order to conserve momentum and energy, it typically remains more uniformly distrubuted around heavy things instead of clumping at the center.  Yes, while it's possible we don't fully understand how gravity works at large scales, and thus need to add in some coupling constants or something, the only problem is that only solves the galaxy rotational curve problem. I doesn't explain the BAO, CMB measurements, Bullet Cluster, or any of he other evidence for dark matter. In order to explain these aspets we need at least four more modifications to gravity, all at different scales. This sounds like a fine-tuning problem to me.  We could easily explain the observed rotation of galaxies if there were just more mass than we see. We assume that the mass in most galaxies is represented by the stars, so there is a 1-1 mapping between stars and mass. We can perfectly explain the roatations of the galaxies with more mass, not just with some very specific distribution of the mass.   To exactly say dark matter only interacts through gravity is not 100% true. In order for us to ever have hopes of detecting it's particles or characterizing it more it must interact with the weak nuclear force. The weak nuclear force governs things like quark flavor changing and beta decay. If we have any hopes of detecting dark matter, it better collide with regular matter and interact at least some of the time. It might do it only very rarely, say like 1 interactions per 100kg of material per year, but it had better happen so we can measure the results of the collision and then characterize the dark matter particles.  Essentially we're not just using the strange properties of dark matter as an excuse why galaxies rotate the way they do, instead we see the behavior they rotate with, and say 'ok that isn't what we expected with normal matter we can see, what amount of matter would we need do have to reproduce that behavior?' we then calculate that amount. Newtonian physics, classical physics from the 1600 allows us to calculate the predicted roations of galaxies and nearly all heavenly bodies. We don't need General Relativity to do that. Newtonian physics doesn't care what types of matter or what kinds of matter it is; it only cares abou amount of mass.       Mv^2/r = GmM/r^2  Is all you need to know to calculate galaxy rotation curves. M and m are masses, G is the gravitational constant, and r is the distance from he center of mass of the object about which the other stuff is rotating. You can see the two Ms cancel, so the rotation speed v is only dependent on the amount of mass at the center of mass of the stuff about which things are rotating, not on the mass of the object doing the rotation.     It then turns or by saying we have 'x amount' more matter the problem could be fixed. Then we look and realize there are other scenarios in the evolution of the Universe that require some sort of new matter we're unfamiliar with, like the CMB measurements, BAO, and the Bullet Cluster, I wonder if it's all the same stuff. It doesn't appear to interact through the E&M force, so it can produce or absorb light, so we call it dark matter.  "

Centripetal acceleration should equal gravitational force, it doesn't - let's postulate that there's some mass we can't see rather than scrap newton's laws. Voila, dark matter.  The issue is that, while the ""dark matter"" piece fits with our other pieces, it borders a piece we also have not yet discovered; another empty space.

The complexity of the real (quantum mechanical) universe increases **factorially**.  Think about that for a second and let it really sink in.  (Factorial growth is notable because it even outstrips exponential growth.)  Now realize that most scientific models of objects any larger than a hydrogen atom are gross simplifications that use mathematical tricks to probe the models for very specific answers to very specific questions.  The models themselves (of objects bigger than hydrogen atoms) do not resemble the physical entities they are shaped around beyond what those simplifications are designed to preserve.  This has been the situation at the deepest level of physics for over 80 years and it will probably continue to be true forever.

It is and *always will be impossible* to make a true simulation that encompasses all of the complexity of the universe, because it would necessarily require all of the processing power (or energy, or ""quantum states of matter"", or whatever is used to make the computations) available in the universe to perfectly simulate it.  The analogy that could be made is that it would be impossible to completely simulate something as complex and powerful as a human brain on a computer that isn't as powerful as the brain it's trying to replicate. You are right to have pointed out that what I said was somewhat misleading, and I apologise for conveying it in such a way.  With this said, I still believe the spirit of what I was trying to express is correct. While we can never simulate exactly every quantum state of a universe like our own, we can simulate a universe with greatly reduced complexity or size... or speed. The inhabitants of the simulation would never realise that their universe is billions of times less complex or 'real' than the universe it's being simulated in.  Perhaps the universe that our hypothetical simulation runs in is thousands of times the size of ours, packed millions of times more densely with matter and energy we couldn't begin to conceive, and their quantum particles are very clearly made up of even tinier particles which are themselves made up of more particles, and all of this energy and complexity has been harnessed to produce our meagre, uninteresting and wholly simple physical reality.  I already hate myself for even starting this sentence, but Sims don't realise that the universe continues past the edge of town, or that walls are made of individual bricks. They can only possibly perceive the reality they exist in. *Their universe* is only a simplistic simulation to *us*.  I'm really sorry for that last paragraph. Truly, I am. Contemporary simulations of life are terrible examples for this sort of thing...  *However, it would theoretically be possible to simulate the entire universe without using all of the energy in the universe - as long as the simulation ran at greatly reduced speed. For example, I could run Simulation_of_the_entire_universe.exe on my computer, but it would run very, very slowly. Of course, this would also mean that the real universe would die to entropy when the simulation universe was only a tiny fraction of its equivalent age.*"

There's no mistake in that, as long as you're working within the respective theory.

In Hicks' quote, he points out to us that the very nature of what we consider reality is at best subjective and at worst completely wrong.  We are *very* limited as far as our perspective on the universe.  We see objects, we see people, we feel our human perception of time.  The spectrum of possible perspectives is overwhelming and beautiful.  (The bit about the collective unconscious can be taken directly if that's your thing or as just another perspective on the human species and society as an organism to itself)  The lyrics of the song, in my opinion, express the same notion that years spent in pursuit of understanding and perspective have ultimately led the author back to the beginning of his development.

"k1hdm","Dark Matter May Be an Illusion","c2hwt0d","Deleted","Jeez, how old was your magazine?  From the [Dark Matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Modified_gravity_laws) page:  >The earliest modified gravity model to emerge was Mordehai Milgrom's Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in 1983, which adjusts Newton's laws to create a stronger gravitational field when gravitational acceleration levels become tiny (such as near the rim of a galaxy). It had some success in predicting galactic-scale features, such as rotational curves of elliptical galaxies, and dwarf elliptical galaxies, etc. It fell short in predicting galaxy cluster lensing. However, MOND was not relativistic, since it was just a straight adjustment of the older Newtonian account of gravitation, not of the newer account in Einstein's general relativity. Work began soon after to make MOND conform to General Relativity. It's an ongoing process, and many competing theories have emerged based around the original MOND theory, such as TeVeS, and MOG or STV gravity, phenomenological covariant approach,[79] etc.  Right then, this guy isn't a crackpot, he proposed his theory in *1983*. The evidence for dark matter wasn't exactly compelling back then. And it doesn't look like he was exactly *shunned*, either, considering how many competing theories that have spawned from his.  The problem is, we received that new data in 2006 from the bullet cluster which was predicted by dark matter and not by MOND or any else. That doesn't completely put the issue to rest, but it makes dark matter by far the most successful (if still frustratingly vague) theory to date.  >I've ignored nothing.  Literally [the first thing I ever typed to you](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k1hdm/dark_matter_may_be_an_illusion/c2h1ghb) was a sentence linking to the bullet cluster asking if his theory could explain it.  >Obviously there can be no examples where someone was prevented from making significant advancements in science because those advancements wouldn't happen.  Then why did you claim there was lots of evidence?  >Because they created the theory they're working on and the one that might be better was made by someone who has nothing to do with them. What good is it to say ""yea, that guy's right"" when you can be Newton/Einstein instead.  If someone **proves** that you're **wrong**, it takes a strange kind of delusion to carry on thinking you can be Einstein or Newton.  >Now you try to paint me as a conspiracy nut.  Now you try to obfuscate my point, so I'll restate it. There are lots of scientists with the expertise necessary to determine theories' validity who have no investment in the theories themselves. The only reasons they could have to universally reject a theory is that they think it's wrong or that there's a conspiracy.  >And by what expertise do you call a professional scientist a crackpot?  Well, I know about the bullet cluster, so I know how unlikely it is for someone to come up with a satisfactory theory that doesn't somehow involve dark matter. It's clear now that he isn't, but the way you portrayed him reminded me of something like [Zephir_AWT](http://aetherwavetheory.blogspot.com/). His shtick is that he's solved a bunch of problems in physics, it's just that nobody will listen to him because the system is corrupted. He's not the only one, either. I probably should have asked you specifically about the guy earlier, because it's nothing like that.  >Ok, it's clearly not worth my time to have a conversation with a troll like yourself. ""This guy believes something different than the mainstream, he can't be an actual scientist."" I guess I'll let you get back to your circle jerk.  If someone claims they've *solved* problems like dark matter in physics but nobody is taking them seriously, it's probably because they don't fully understand those problems to begin with. I can see that's not the case with Milgrom, though, since he had access to a much smaller range of data than modern scientists, and many people did/do take him seriously.  >There are plenty of examples of bullying, shunning and politics. I can't know if this has prevented actual advancement of science or not but it seems likely that it would sooner or later.  I don't deny that it can be ugly and political (if I did then I take that back), I just don't think that the truth about something as important and well-known as dark matter can be suppressed for long. If a theory has a Wikipedia page almost 30 years after it was proposed, then I don't think its problem is a lack of people taking it seriously."

Please try to use sources from the last few years, as many of the criticisms directed at MOND have lately been silenced by new research. Bekenstein's paper is a great place to start. Also, it would help to have some grasp of the history of dark matter theories -- currently, the most attractive aspect of dark matter is its reliability in predicting gravitational lensing, but it has never been as accurate or consistent as MOND in predicting rotational curves in galaxies and clusters.

Also trivial.  If we believe dark matter only interacts with normal matter gravitationally, not electromagnetically, then ordinary particle detection won't work even if we're engulfed in dark matter particles.  Our technology for detecting gravity as such minute scales is still in the dark ages; we're just not good at it yet.  Or it could be more like neutrino's, and just be brutally hard to detect because they're electromagnetically neutral particles that fly through normal matter like watch through a screen door.  It's absolutely possible that dark matter doesn't exist; but it's still our current best idea by far.  It explains all known evidence; something no other hypothesis can do.
