It is theoretical science, people. Itâs meant to be âout thereâ. By design. Thatâs the whole idea. To shame it is to simply project your own faults and fears.

Others then inverted to believe that instead all stars would be like ours with many planets.

Another example is anti-matter. When exposed to normal matter it destroys itself and releases all the energy hat the two particles once had (in the form of heat, sound and photons). Anti matter cannot coexist with normal matter, donât forget these are actual polar opposites to each other. Nothing is actual directly related to each other until you look at the quantum level.

Or, that out models of how things work is somehow flawed or just incomplete.  Imagine if we didn't know what relativity was but we kept observing a mass increase in certain lab conditions.  Imagine we just chalked it up to dark matter? Oh, and a hidden 10th planet that is the real reason for mercury's orbital anomalies.  That's my take,",https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw4lqg9BQCy

tufan_dilli,2019-04-30 19:08:30,"@imabraroficial vague af. The simple answere is the heisenberg uncerta. that makes things unable  to be meassured in relation to its value and change of the value. For example, you can only know the momentum or the position at a current time, because its like shooting a picture of a moving object. You can vaguely tell where it is, but since it is an image, you cannot tell its velocity. Since can be infinitly dense (black holes) but its just super hard to analyze, because of quantum mechanical effects.",https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw4lqg9BQCy
