1,,Science & Astronomy,100066796034727,25/04/24 14:10:54,10,,This should be blowing peoples minds. There's so much about this I want to know. How have they doubled checked their findings. Is the rate at which this Galaxy spins what we would expect if no Dark Matter existed? In what other ways does this galaxy differ from the norm? How can this galaxy even be formed and stay together without Dark Matter?There's just SO much to be learned here if this is true. Possibly including what is causing Dark Matter in the first place.,view comment
2,,Physics & Astronomy,100083570115877,25/04/24 14:11:23,,,I thought we were still working on being able to see dark matter directly. How can we tell if something has or does not have it?,view comment

7,,Ron Kemp,100000729526018,25/04/24 15:45:07,1,,"Dark matter is an artifact.  When the motion of a star or galaxy like our Milky Way cannot be explained by the amount of mass in the system the first thing done is blame it on dark matter.  Dark matter becomes a wildcard variable that can be used in any situation when the laws of motion and theory of gravity cannot fully explain.  This doesn't mean it exists.  It simply means the laws of motion and theory of gravity are incomplete, can't explain the motion.  Dark matter is the ""placeholder, wildcard, or whatever you want to call it to explain what theories and laws cannot.I believe I discovered what they neglected to include in their equations.  It's a slow but constant acceleration that only occurs to stars and galaxies over time because they radiate a rapid wind of hot charged particles.  Once in motion always in motion unless acted upon by an outside force.  Well, stars and galaxies produce a solar wind, which is an action.  Then what is the reaction?  The reaction is a slow but constant acceleration in the direction they're already traveling.  Thus the older the star or galaxy is, the more momentum they will have gained over time.Sure enough, young diffuse galaxies don't appear to be affected by dark matter.  Planets and other small bodies are not affected by dark matter.  Young stars do not appear to be affected by dark matter.  The key word is young.  Because the bodies are young then this slow acceleration would not show up in measurements.I believe I even came up with a value that explains it.  A slow but constant acceleration of 0.00000482 in/s (0.0000122 cm/s).  It's about twice the width of a proton every second.  It comes out to be around a 1 mi/h (1.61 km/h) increase in velocity every 10,000 years.  Slow but constant acceleration over the lifetime of the star or galaxy.  It's so slow that in our short lifetime, a maximum of 120 years we are unable to detect this acceleration.A galaxy like our Milky Way that is 13.7 billion years old would have accumulated an extra velocity of around 1,370,000 mi/h.  Our sun being 4.5 billion years old would have accumulated an extra 450,000 mi/h.  The older the star or galaxy is the more their motion will appear to be a mystery.I call it the AP theory for Accelerated Propulsion.It not only explains the extra motion but also explains why satellite galaxies and stars orbiting a galaxy faster than a million miles per hour are unable to reach an escape velocity.  Think about it.  If the acceleration is a constant 0.00000482 in/s (0.0000122 cm/s) then it's not enough of a jolt to change their orbital trajectory.  So they will continue to orbit, never able to reach an escape velocity regardless of the velocity they've accumulated over time.Thus why the book I published about this is called DARK MATTER IS DEAD by Ron Kemp.  Mystery solved.  The motion blamed on dark matter or missing mass is actually a slow but constant acceleration occurring to stars and galaxies over time.  There is no need to assume dark matter particles, things that can't be measured or observed if stars and galaxies are slowly propelling themselves.I provided this knowledge freely.  Don't hate me.  If you don't agree, then please explain why.",view comment

But they never admitted mistakes while Scientists found a easy way to predict things  mathematical where they can be sure that there will be a discrepancy because of there mathematical unbalanced rules of multiplication and division which has substantial deficiency in the negativ number area and have zero as something which either in multiplikation makes everything disappear or is even undefined when used as divisor. So they get funding and when they are wrong they get even more funding in hope they set it right which is mathematical impossible. The Scientific Money perpetual mobile.

15,,Kevin Warne,100001176480209,26/04/24 08:26:31,,,"Modified gravity is the answer but not MOND. A complete rethink of gravity is required, finally realising it is an apparent force set up between areas of 4D space that are expanding at different relative rates. Matter will reduce the rate of $D expansion of the space around it but displace such space so reduce the so called gravitational constant at the same time.",view comment
