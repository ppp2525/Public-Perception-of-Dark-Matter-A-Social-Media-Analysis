2,,Marlon Jeffrey Bowen,1441607983,21/03/24 00:59:17,,,Dark matter may be matter intelligent life doesn't want in the show. There are 1001 ways to hide stars and planets but none to hide gravity. They wouldn't want their star dying and would recycle the energy anyway. See my profile for more details,view comment

It seems to me that we do know a little about it. For example, since Vera Rubin's work in the 1970s, Galaxy rotation curves are known to indicate the presence of Dark Matter, perhaps in the Galaxy halo !? Though, to be fair, the opening paragraph of the article does also mention these ""gravitational effects"".So Alex McDaniel's study of dwarf galaxies is the path featured in this article.""Dwarf galaxies are ideal for study because they are small, rich in dark matter and mostly lack other astrophysics phenomena such as gas, dust and supernova that could contaminate the findings.""""We look for these because ideally, they give us a clean signal or allow us to rule out certain particle theories""."".... compared to previous studies, we do start to see a hint of something that might be a signal from these systems [ dark matter having a certain mass and cross section, I think ].""I don't have time to read the actual paper, though it would be interesting to know, what aspects the concept of a signal in this context involves. It would be neat and logical if the idea of a signal was mysterious and evolving, if you get my drift !! That's because, I don't think there are yet many certainties about what exotic particle(s) Dark Matter may be !!👍👍",view comment
