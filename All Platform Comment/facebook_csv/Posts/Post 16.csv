So he doesn't swallow stars, planets or asteroids. And no massive body except another black hole can reach his event horizon.All this leads us to ask the following question: why have some astrophysicists tried to study what is beyond the event horizon of black holes using unrealistic models of gravitationnal quantum physics, when the quantum physics study matter at the subatomic level, while a black hole is an astophysical object that belong to a macroscopic world that is subject to the entropy and the arrow of time?Indeed, beyond the event horizon of each black hole there is a very large closed iron gate that sits at the base of a tower of an enormous fort constructed using extremely strong material. solid and compact. This fort is over 120,000 light-years tall, and it surrounds the entire Prime Heaven, while the solid ground of the Prime Heaven is the roof of the universe.Finally, in the First Heaven there is the House of Glory, Hell, and great white palaces.",view comment

So what alterations have you made to his plagiarized theory from Russia astronomers to make this absurd statement work?  You do know that his colleague quit on him because of his dishonest practices?  also do you have a piece of dark matter to show me so I can see it for myself as a fact ,or is it like bigfoot and Martian flying saucers, and I JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE YOU?

15,,Valeriy Polulyakh,100004321927237,28/05/23 00:19:11,,,"It seems that the measurement of the event horizon of a black hole directly would be direct evidence. However, by the nature of a horizon, any real measurement of the event horizon will Ibe indirect. The Event Horizon Telescope will get picture of the silhouette of the Sgr A* which is due to optical effects of spacetime outside of the event horizon. The result will be  determined by the simple In search of black holes and dark matter astrophysicists are relying on indirect observations. quality of the resulting image that does not depend on the properties of the spacetime within the image. So, it will be also indirect and an existence of BH is a hypothesis.  https://www.academia.edu/12468184/Are_there_Black_Holes_and_Dark_Matter_in_the_Milky_Way",view comment

This expansion produced movement,mass cohesion,heat,light,nuclear fusion which is an unstable continuum.The equilibrium that existed before were made up of a sea of massless  particles I would say is dark matter.I think that the expansion is displacing dark matter and moving to a new state of eventual equilibrium.",view comment
