10,,Fernando Pretto,100005913340257,11/03/24 13:05:33,1,,"Cience comunity has to understand that a theory is just a thought, an Idea, and doesn't prove anything. And they have to humble to accept and tell people that they are just thinking about something that they don't Know, don't understand and can't prove. In other words ""cientific faith""",view comment
11,,Rob Wilmot,732160491,11/03/24 13:21:38,7,,"we must always remember that theories are all but guesses, usually based on other guesses based on many unknowns. It's often become a dogma with lack of thinking outside the box. Let's go back to being more creative with ideas and then proving them too.  ""The individual, cosmic and social dimensions are considered. It is held that creativity blockages can be overcome and that "" ‘loosening’ rigidly held intellectual content in the tacit infrastructure of consciousness"" plays a main role for awakening creative intelligence."" - from Science, Order, and Creativity - Bohm, Peat.   So far whatever theories there are about anything - NOTHING is ruled out. Even the notion we and everting are all one pulsating wave",view comment

13,,Dominic Defrank,100003784918105,11/03/24 13:33:27,1,,A very interesting Theory in a new way of looking at it because we have not seen any Dark Matter anywhere we can't see it touch it or feel it therefore what we're observing is a mystery but this Theory the Rippling of space-time actually fits the observation! But both theories can't be proven at this point in time!,view comment

15,,Ian Winter,576174984,11/03/24 16:16:02,,,"Kind of fits in with the theory I have been passing round for years.(decades)You remember the experiment they use to demo gravity - with the rubber sheet and a ball-bearing (or trampoline and bowling ball)that shows how space distorts around a mass.Well imagine the rubber sheet was over a sealed drum. it still pushes down near the mass but now it pushes up where there is no mass. This small space distortion where there is nothing there, is what we have been calling dark matter.I have not done the maths or modeling, or got drunk with a group of astrophysicists, but it is my theory.Have fun, and let me know if you think it works.",view comment
16,,Joanna Tilsley,100055158293611,11/03/24 17:05:49,,,"There’s an aphorism that Carl Sagan made popular: ‘Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’. Whether it is or whether it isn’t, my view is that there are things that are so far outside our Human understanding that we are like the proverbial blind wise men trying to describe the elephant.",view comment
