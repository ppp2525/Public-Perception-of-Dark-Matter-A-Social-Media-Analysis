9,,Richard Samuel Kerr,100003022389241,08/03/18 23:38:59,,,"Another universe just bumping up against ours? If that’s the case, the percentage of dark matter may change over time, reflecting the nearby universe’s shape. This could describe two nearby membranes close to each other that are not entirely flat, but that have a topography. Maybe that membrane undulates. If we could measure the dark matter precisely enough, we might detect slight changes in the percentage of dark matter, and that would suggest that parts of the nearby nearby universe were getting closer or moving way. Any change at all in the percentage would tell us something important.",view comment
10,,Richard Samuel Kerr,100003022389241,08/03/18 23:43:00,,,"If dark matter were to suggest a nearby universe, it would explain why it appears to be so non reactive with our own. Maybe only some aspects of dark matter such as gravity can interact with our universe, that might explain why the gravitational force is so weak,  if it is shared across universes, there is some theory about that.",view comment

20,,Richard Samuel Kerr,100003022389241,09/03/18 03:06:16,,,"If Dark Matter were in another universe near us, it would appear to be all over our own universe not “outside” somewhere, since there is no outside (as we think of it!) to our universe. The other universe would be right next to every spot in our universe. Picture a globe with red dots, representing regular matter printed on it and all over again would be printed in black dots. The universe of red dots would be separate from the universe of black dots representing black matter, but they needn’t interact with each other. However they might still have weight and gravity when measured together.",view comment
