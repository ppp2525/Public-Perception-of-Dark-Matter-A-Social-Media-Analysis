5,,Valeriy Polulyakh,100004321927237,28/05/21 19:34:08,5,,"Recently two papers have been published. The first one [1] deals with the measurement of the speed of rotation of galaxies and, in our view, closes the issue of the existence of dark matter. The second one [2] argues that the expansion of the universe is not accelerating. However, this fact does not answer the question as to what in general is the cause of the universe's expansion and does not address the widespread opinion that 70% of the universe consists of dark energy. The central idea of a new paradigm [3, 4] is an existence of a certain entity – the elaston, which can give rise to the physical Euclidean space, matter and energy all the way along its evolution. Investigations of the large scale structure of the World revealed its high non-homogeneity. The foam-like structure becomes more and more obvious. The building blocks of the large scale structure are superclusters and voids which are forming the supercluster-void network. The new paradigm gives the key to the explanation of such a structure.  https://www.academia.edu/31095808/There_Arent_any_Arguments_for_the_Existence_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy ",view comment

We don't have a great understanding of the universe yet. Dark matter and dark energy are simply placeholders for something we don't know yet. My logical mind hates the thought of using these two unknown units to make calculations and base theories around it.
