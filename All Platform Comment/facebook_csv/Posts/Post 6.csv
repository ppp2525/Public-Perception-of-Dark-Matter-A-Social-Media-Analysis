1,,Marshall Eubanks,728570814,08/03/15 15:48:15,,,"These axion searches are based on the Primakoff effect - two photons interact and generate one axion, and so depend on having very strong light sources. (That functions the other way, too, 1 axion -> 2 photons, which is how the ""shining light through the walls"" axion helioscopes work.)http://collargroup.uchicago.edu/projects/axion/images/axions-fig2_large.gif",view comment
