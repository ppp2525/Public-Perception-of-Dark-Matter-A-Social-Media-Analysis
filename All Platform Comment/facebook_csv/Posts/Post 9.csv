While I was reading it, I was able to keep up with the science, but trying to explain to someone why they should read it is difficult. It's your best work...and I have been reading you since the Andrew Z. Thomas days!!",view comment

9,,Shell Shellington,545705909,24/04/24 19:40:36,2,,"This has filled me with so much (more) excitement. Dark Matter made questions and emotions surface about my own life.I studied conceptual art, and putting meaning to what you’re doing isn’t always easy or obvious. Sometimes it’s buried so deep that it can take a decade to make sense of it.I appreciate your honesty in this, and I always enjoy hearing you talk about your writing.To have a window into another’s brain! You are the kind of writer that plants the seeds the future sews. Scary stomach churning and super exciting at the same time.Congratulations. I’m very much looking forward to it… counting down the sleeps like a kid at Christmas time 🤣",view comment
