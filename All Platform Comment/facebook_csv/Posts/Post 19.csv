2,,James Allen McEuin,631721750,08/03/24 15:49:44,,,"This article fails to state why dark anything was proposed in the first place. Dark anything simply means that the equation isn't balanced. Let's keep it simple with an easy math problem.  2 + ? = 4  We observe 4 and we can observe 2 but we can't observe what balances the left and the right. We assume that what we see on the right is the total so we assume there is another 2 that is missing and because we can't see it then it is dark to us. Neptune was predicted to exist based on gravitational effects and was visibly confirmed as a result of narrowing down the search field. Neptune was unknown, it was dark. The latest dark matter and energy theories exist because calculations of galactic and universal movements can't be balanced based on what is observed on either side of the equation. The false assumption is we can see all that can be seen. That said, after the Voyager craft left our solar system we ""surprisingly"" discovered that intergalactic space has more matter and energy than previously thought because it was not observed from Earth. Neither of these (matter or energy) observations were done with special dark matter detectors. Yes, I can acknowledge that we don't know what is all out there but the entire modern premise of dark matter and energy is about us knowing all about what we can interact with which is a false assumption. The truth is that not one dark anything experiment has proven anything. It is so bad that a university researcher who spoke at our local society stated that he hopes he is right because his entire financial livelihood is at stake so he will continue to propose research projects despite the lack of any proof because his degree and entire career is worthless otherwise and he would be financially ruined otherwise. So that really sums it up. Follow the money. The research only continues because it is the only way those who study it will ever do more than be a fry cook at your local fast food burger joint. The reality is that in the scientific community once you have been proven to have chased a false narrative all these years you won't be accepted elsewhere because you already proved yourself gullible and fallible in your ability to make good logical scientific conclusions.",view comment
