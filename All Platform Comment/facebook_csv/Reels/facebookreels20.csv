Galaxies attracting towards supermassive blackholes will bypass through those tunnels to exit outside in the vacuumed universesKnowing the concept of missing piece (Dark Matter) would Unravel many crises of cosmology, so based on my own model of the shape of the universe,  moreover based on my own model of the creation of the cosmos,  Dark matter existed backwards in time, before the Big Bang. Pre-universe ( Dark Matter) existed  before the Big Bang.The Big Bang happened in the central point of that Pre-universe resulting in formation of galaxies and splitting the outer shell of that pre-universe to seven outer vacuumed parallel universes. Those seven higher vacuumed dimensional parallel universes are what is called Dark Matter. At the same time, those seven higher vacuumed dimensional parallel universes are what is called Dark Energy .Big bang singularity was a central point in four dimensional universe .The Big Bang happened in the central point of the four fundamental universe, resulting in the inflation of that pre-universe and splitting its boundaries to seven outer higher vacuumed dimensional parallel universes with supermassive blackholes embedded in that new structures.Galaxies in our four dimensional universe are flying apart from each other attracting towards that outer seven dimensional higher vacuumed universes ( that is what is called expanding universe) .When the distance between galaxies and the outer higher vacuumed dimensional parallel universes decreases, the expansion of the universe increases ( that is what is known as the acceleration of the expansion of the universe.)Those supermassive blackholes are tunnels connecting between our four dimensional universe and the outer  seven higher vacuumed dimensional universes. Galaxies attracting towards supermassive blackholes will bypass through those tunnels to exit outside in the vacuumed universesHere's my own model of the shape of the universe:Farid Haras, Ph.D

17,,Kenny McDaniel,100078368347799,01/11/23 17:21:47,6,,"Yeah lets not even consider, another one of Einstein's theories that is not correct or ""our"" math is broken. Always having to add more particles to everything. Light is not a particle! Light has never been a particle! Scalar waves do move faster than C. How many things do we now have that are invariant?? Meaning they do not align with Einstein's theories or y'alls. Hey Doc I think you're a very intelligent man so I have one question to ask you and I wish you would get back to me on this;IF WE HAVE NOT FOUND THE ANSWERS ( a unified field Theory, why all of these theories break down in a black hole. Why every time, we find something that does not conform to E equals MC square, we just called it an invariant and ignore it like it's not staring Us in the face. Etc.) IN SAID BOX WHY DO ""WE"" KEEP DUCT- TAPING THE BOX? How about if we look outside the box? Oh yeah peer review. Also, let's not Overlook the FACT that a spaceship, chunk of iron or whatever does not increase in Mass as it approaches C! If a particle can be sent around the LHC at near C and gains no Mass, why would a conglomerate of particles / atoms cause it to do so?Dark matter = Duct-tape!! Throw the damn box away and start over.",view comment

23,,Brian Klock,1257512907,04/11/23 14:26:10,1,,"That’s all pure ignorance … gravity is a result of the background permeative particle fields, so there’s no such thing as measuring gravity everywhere.If there exists a balanced mass of galaxies on all sides of you, the background permeative particle fields will simply be slightly weaker, you’ll have no net gravitational pull in any direction, and the gravitational force in your surroundings will be very slightly weaker.A gravitational field is stronger downward permeative particle fields within the space around an object … which is what does the work of pushing nearby matter toward the object.
