25,,Josh Nelson,100001842131232,27/02/24 10:11:00,1,,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matterhere's the wiki page for the ignorant masses to educate themselves, doubt they even bothered to look it up on their own before spouting a bunch of bs cause they're too ignorant to understand what dark matter is.To sum it up, Dark Matter, is a placeholder term for a substance we haven't the proper means of analyzing and can only theorize about the nature of what it is based on all other forms of evidence that explains how things in the universe work, but can't be observed in certain locations, hence Dark Matter is a placeholder used to describe this impossible to see the source of gravity. Something with mass has to exist in order for a celestial body to orbit, otherwise there's nothing tethering it. Think of it like you being completely invisible, your body, clothes and you're holding an invisible rope around a horse's neck and the horse is made to run and you're making it circle around you using the rope. you and the rope can't be seen in this case but the horse is still forced to run in circles. That is basically what is happening with Dark Matter. There are planets that are seemingly orbiting empty space, and we know that without a certain amount of mass, a gravitational field to pull an object and cause it to orbit is required. The Dark Matter is the placeholder for this unknown mass in the universe that allows for there to be gravity in a place we can't see it in any form beyond the fact that something with enough mass to generate a gravitational pull is affecting stars and planets and other celestial bodies.",view comment

We also know that there is plenty of (normal matter) gas around the galactic center. If there WAS a antimatter star, there would be ENORMOUS amounts of energy being emitted from that (baryonic/normal) gas falling onto that antimatter star and annihilating each other.Nobody in the scientific community thinks that there's a antimatter star there.",view comment
