You want to make this post and mention his name but yet you don't want to mention what exactly happened to him and what the CIA did to him? How come are you afraid of the CIA? The poster of this is nothing but a low life scumbag you don't want to post the truth you want to post your truth not the actual truth that makes this fake news,view comment

7,,Thomas Doerring,1738492099,05/04/23 10:04:03,1,,This and other scientific research will eventually kill us all. Sometimes knowing to much is to much. This was a way to produce anti matter. They thought. Or was is a black hole. Or perpetual energy. I heard scientists are experimenting with wasps that control there victims by injecting there stinger in the brain. Releasing a control compound. Why would they want this. ?This is only for control. They want to control something. Someone. And who do you think is giving money for this. We need to stop. We need to find a better way.,view comment
