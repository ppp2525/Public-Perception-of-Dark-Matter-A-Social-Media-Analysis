12,,PJ Pagano,1662032869,06/07/23 13:53:54,1,,A dark matter star? How about it’s a black hole? Reputable astrophysicists believe there may not even be any dark matter. The unknown mass in spiral galaxies may just be thousands of black holes that contribute all the mass that is needed to justify the excess gravitational pull need to hold them together. After all. Spiral galaxies are the most mature galaxies in the universe.,view comment

15,,John Hoey,1282724325,07/07/23 14:43:06,,,"Interesting. If it is a boson star then the question needing an answer is how did this dark matter dissipate enough energy to be able to collapse into a coherent mass?Also, since bosons don't obey the Pauli exclusion principal, what would stop that energy losing mechanism to continue until it became a black hole?If there is such a mechanism this could help explain the existence of primordial supermassive black holes.",view comment
