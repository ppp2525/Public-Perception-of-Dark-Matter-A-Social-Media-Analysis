Even Einstein theories aren not 100%. There are just too many theories, so everybody goes bla bla bla, if this, maybe that. Please come with some new facts.",view comment

10,,Bill Leonard,1439961778,27/04/24 21:28:47,,,"Note that it’s important to understand what’s a scientific theory :A theory is the highest level of explanation in science. Some features of scientific theories are that they:* have been thoroughly tested over an extended period* provide accurate explanations and predictions for a wide range of phenomena* are widely accepted by the scientific community* demonstrate strong experimental and observational supportIt is not uncommon for people to use the word ""theory"" to refer to something that is uncertain or just a guess. For example, someone might say, ""I don't know if that is correct. It is just a theory.""However, in science, ""theory"" has a different meaning: the best scientific explanation for how things work. A theory is not a guess or an unknown. It represents a heightened and tested level of scientific knowledge. A theory, by definition, has been tested multiple times by different people and provides a robust working model of how the natural world functions. A theory is supported by multiple lines of evidence. However, scientific theories are not static, unchanging truths. With new observations and reasoning, theories can develop and change. It is also possible to disprove theories with new data that contradict their underlying assumptions.https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-the-scientific-theory-definition-characteristics-example.html",view comment
