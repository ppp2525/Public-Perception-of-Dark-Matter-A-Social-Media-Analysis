We don't even know of physics remains the same in distant galaxies that have different stars from our own. Nothing out in the universe, that scientists proclaim, can be verified, so ots all THEORY. And while THEORY may be cult upon things we already know, theories of the universe are incomplete. Because we are going off of things qe have proven here, on earth or in our own solar system, with a yellow sun. Now I'm not saying that physics differs if there is a different sun, what I'm saying .... until we go exploring out there, NOTHING CAN BE ASSUMED AS FACT out in the universe!

65,,Kurt Wallenhorst,100007343891037,07/05/23 14:45:39,,,"What is Dark Energy?Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that is believed to permeate all of space and accelerate the expansion of the universe. It was first proposed in the late 1990s when astronomers were studying supernovae and discovered that they were accelerating away from each other at an increasing rate. Dark energy is thought to make up about 68% of the total energy density of the universe, with dark matter accounting for another 27%, leaving only 5% for ordinary matter.The nature of dark energy remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics. There are several theories about what it could be, but none have been proven conclusively. One possibility is that it is a property of space itself, known as vacuum energy or the cosmological constant. Another theory suggests that it could be a new type of field, similar to the Higgs field that gives particles mass. Yet another possibility is that it could be related to modifications of gravity on cosmic scales.The existence of dark energy was first inferred from observations of distant supernovae by two independent teams in 1998. Since then, numerous other observations have supported this conclusion, including measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, large-scale galaxy clustering, and gravitational lensing.Understanding dark energy is crucial for understanding the ultimate fate of the universe. If dark energy continues to accelerate the expansion of the universe, eventually all galaxies will be so far apart that they will no longer be visible from each other. This scenario, known as the ""Big Freeze,"" would result in a cold and dark universe where no new stars could form.???? ???? ?? ????????-???????????????? ???????? ????????. ?????? ???????????? ???? ???? ???????????? ?????? ???????????????? ?????? ???? ???????? ???? ?????????????? ????????, ???????????? ?????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ???? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ??????. ?? ???? ?????? ??? ?????? ???????? ?????? ?????????????????? ???? ?????? ????? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ??????????????. ?? ???? ??????????????.",view comment
