2,,RussColburn,19/01/23,31,,31,"There have been many attempts to modify gravity - look up MOND. The problem so far with MOND has been it explains a few things better than General Relativity and dark matter, but then can't explain a number of things that dark matter does explain, such as the Bullet Cluster. In the colliding galaxies of the cluster, we see gravitational effects from something passing through the collision without any effects while the baryonic matter has slowed down due to collisions. If it was because of gravity, we would expect all the gravitational effects to remain with the baryonic matter.

I've followed MOND and its brethren for a decade or so as it did seem to have a future, but its holes continue to plague it.",no,view comment

5,,DrunkenPhysicist,19/01/23,7,,7,"The problem is how? General relativity stems from two postulates: the laws of physics are the same in all frames of reference and that gravitational mass and inertial mass are the same (or you cannot distinguish gravitational acceleration from other types). One, or both, of these postulates would need to be broken to modify our understanding of gravity. People try, but serious consequences arise if you break these.

6,,isparavanje,19/01/23,267,,267,"Finally, something that I specialise in!

The key reason is that there are many different pieces of evidence that relatively independently point towards dark matter. These include (non-exhaustive list) galaxy rotation curves, of course, but also large scale structure formation, baryon-acoustic oscillations and the power matter spectrum of the universe, the cosmic microwave background, strong lensing of galaxy clusters, and colliding clusters (bullet cluster for example).

These pieces of evidence stretch across many different scales, from that of the largest scales in the universe (structure formation) to the smallest galaxies that we can reliably measure the mass of using rotation curves.

It is perhaps possible to string together a theory that explains everything using modified gravity, but it hasn't really been done yet. Some attempts do come close, though; there was [a paper a few years ago on PRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00082) that does manage to partially explain the CMB with modified gravity. The issue is that once we get into really really complex modifications to theory, the fundamental attractiveness of modified gravity goes away; this intricate theory with all the frills needed to explain disparate observations is far more complex than just 'oh yeah there's some stuff we haven't managed to detect or produce in a lab yet'. The latter is also quite easy to believe since we've been finding new particles in the lab every once in a while for decades now. 

In addition, even the paper I mentioned also, as far as I know, still doesn't explain all the pieces of evidence (see: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00082). It looks likely that modified gravity theories need dark matter to work (for an example, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11292), so dark matter probably exists, regardless of whether our understanding of gravity is complete. To be clear, I am glad people are working on modified gravity theories still. We don't want to have blind spots in science. However, I think it is far less promising an avenue of research, and it is not what I am spending my time on. I spend my time on reddit instead (/s...kinda)",no,view comment
7,,tacoman202,19/01/23,24,,24,"Even though the material in galaxies is significantly spread out (Relatively speaking), collisions on smaller scales, for example between atoms/molecules of interstellar gas, can cause visible shock fronts due to interactions in the baryonic matter.

Sixty Symbols did a good video on the Bullet Cluster which touches on some of your questions. You can see that there's a discrepancy in the location of the visible matter and where a sizable chunk of the actual mass is located. The reason is because the dark matter halos can simply pass through each other, because they only interact through gravitational forces and therefore can't collide, like baryonic matter can due to electromagnetic forces.

Second, doing that is easier and faster. Considering alternative theories requires to dismiss the interpretation of the observations of the last 70 years. That has been tried many times. The only pseudo-successful modification to my knowledge is called MOND, which is only a modification of Newton's theory, and not GR, and try thus even more incompatible with quantum mechanics.

53,,godowskyliszt,08/02/23,2,,2,"It's also worth noting that we DO see classical radial velocities in some galaxies. In direct response to OPs post, I would wager it's precisely the absence of a purported effect of DM that strengthens the case FOR DM. For example, in any MToG model, the same physics has to hold uniformly, so we shouldn't be able to spot galaxies that DON'T have a behavior consistent with the MToG in question. Yet such galaxies do exist; many of these can be Googled or seen in various research papers, like AGC 114905 et al...

In other words, more broadly, if an explanation for phenomenon X by DM is theory A and one by modified gravity is theory B, the fact that B has to hold in every case strengthens the evidence for A if X is not observed everywhere X applies. While we don't know enough about DM to profer an explicit mechanism for e.g. ""dark matter stripping,"" the absence of DM effects in some galaxies strengthens the applicability of that theory over one relying on modified theories of gravity.
