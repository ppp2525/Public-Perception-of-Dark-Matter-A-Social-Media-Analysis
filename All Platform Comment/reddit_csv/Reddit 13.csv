6,,seeking_horizon,20/07/23,694,,694,"> At the end of their life spans, large dark stars would have collapsed into massive black holes. This could be a potential explanation for some of the ancient supermassive black holes observed in the universe, which seem too large to have formed so quickly from fusion-powered Population III stars, Ilie says.

This doesn't make the dark stars hypothesis true, but it's interesting that a natural explanation for an unrelated problem drops right out of it like this.",no,view comment

314,,twilight-actual,21/07/23,-8,,-8,"I can easily see this happening.  The entire idea that a very small, very concentrated form of the universe suddenly expanded and -- MAGICALLY -- had uniform density and displacement is well, magic.  I'm still convinced that much of what we attibute to dark matter is really primordial blackholes of all sizes.

And how did they test for this to disprove it?  Well, ""we're not seeing Hawking radiation"".  And ""the density doesn't match what we predicted"".

My question to them:  Have we ever seen hawking radiation in the wild?  

No.

And just what exactly are you basing your predictions on?

It's plausible that there was enough of the coldest dark matter in many galaxies to form dark stars. What would remain until the present day would be the dark matter that was of intermediate temperatures. Cold enough to not have escape velocity from the mass concentrations that became galaxies, not so cold that it fell into dark stars and annihilated or was lost forever in a black hole.",no,view comment

The name ""dark matter"" just means matter that doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force, or interacts so rarely that it's almost impossible to observe. It's mass in galaxies that we can't see in observations, but we can see in the gravitational effects.

Neutrinos are an example of a dark matter, but they move too fast, and are not abundant enough to account for the gravitational effects we observe.

The [Bullet Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster) is probably the most visually satisfying proof that there is ""dark matter"".

Two galaxy clusters collided. In the collision, the majority of the visible matter (in pink) separated from the ""dark matter"", which we can't see directly, but we know is there because of gravitational lensing (in blue-ish-purple).

> The stars of the galaxies, observable in visible light, were not greatly affected by the collision, and most passed right through, gravitationally slowed but not otherwise altered.

> The hot gas of the two colliding components, seen in X-rays, represents most of the baryonic, or ""ordinary"", matter in the cluster pair. The gases of the Intracluster medium interact electromagnetically, causing the gases of both clusters to slow much more than the stars.

> The third component, the dark matter, was detected indirectly by the gravitational lensing of background objects.

Looking at the [image](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0808/bullet_cluster_c60w.jpg), (pink) is where the majority of the visible matter is located, but (blue-ish-purple) is where we see gravitational lensing.

511,,Horsepipe,21/07/23,4,,4,"That wouldn't make sense though. Einstein's general theory of relativity has been demonstrated to be the correct model of gravitational interactions for large bodies. It works on planetary scales and it works on scales of supermassive black holes. But then it completely breaks down at galactic and galaxy cluster scales. 

So we can measure the masses of individual stars to a pretty good degree of accuracy. We can measure the density of molecular gas clouds to a pretty good degree of accuracy. When we look at distant structures in the universe everything looks pretty uniformly distributed in them. When you can estimate the mass of the stars and gas in a given area it's just math at that point to get an estimate on the mass of something like a galaxy. 

The problem is the estimated mass of these galaxies is barely even a fraction of what should be required to hold something like a galaxy cluster gravitationally bound together. The cluster as a whole is moving through space at a good percentage of the speed of light and those galaxies are way too far apart from one another to be clinging on to each other with just the gravity of the combined mass of all the stars and dust contained within them.",no,view comment

581,,ku8475,21/07/23,1,,1,"That's an interesting idea I hadn't thought about before. What if energy and mass on a galactic scale have properties, characteristics, or functions unique to that scale. In the sub-atomic realm I believe (not sure as I don't math that hard yet) while we didn't initially expect unique interactions we can predict and now prove them with new mathematical models. What's interesting is on the sub-atomic level it's easier to figure out because everything larger works differently right? There's a line between atomic and sub-atomic interactions.  

If things work differently with no fine line on the massive side it becomes increasingly difficult to hypothesize when, how, and why the change from Einsteinian physics occur. We can't discount it and frankly it would be incredible if true, but if I understand the problem correctly it would be very very difficult to prove mathematically vs using dark matter that fits nearly into our current models. Don't let that stop you though, get on that math wagon and start figuring out how to prove it!",no,view comment

736,,friendtoalldogs0,21/07/23,5,,5,"I think the idea is that in the modern universe, everything (including dark matter) has a bunch of angular momentum, so without something like friction to bleed off that momentum, dark matter will form a big puffed up cloud of stable, circular orbits, keeping most of the mass well away from the center. But, in the very early universe, there were large systems of matter and dark matter without much angular momentum, so they could collapse more or less in a straight line toward their shared center of gravity, which would result in highly elliptical orbits with much of the mass passing through the same point, potentially allowing dark matter to reach a high enough density to form a black hole",no,view comment
