6,,darkenergymaven,16/01/2022,6,,6,"Part of OP’s question was why we, even after much effort, we don’t know what dark matter or dark energy are - I’ll try to address that part of the question. 

For Dark Matter the problem is that given what we know - ie DM interacts mostly gravitationally and only weakly with itself or normal matter - the problem is that we can only easily detect things that emit light or interact more with matter. So by its very nature - whether DM are wimps or axions or something else - it is going to be hard to detect. 

The situation is somewhat different for Dark Energy - DE isn’t a particle, but rather a cosmological constant, vacuum energy or quantum field. Our measurements of the universe’s expansion are now good enough to say that DE is either the cosmological constant or something that is acting somewhat similarly.

This means that the galaxies within the two clusters mostly just pass on by, but the collided dust ends up in between the two clusters.

The intergalactic dust is far more massive than the stellar component of the cluster, so without dark matter you would expect the majority of the mass to be in the middle with all the dust. When you compare the location of the dust (using x-ray imaging) to the mass distribution (using gravitational lensing), you find that instead the majority of the mass is where the stellar components are.

Well its either particles which don't interact with others much other than gravitationally, or its MACHOs. Both are dark matter in the wider sense of the term and I'm sure you don't deny the existence of some MACHOs.

MACHOs can be baryonic (normal matter), such as rogue planets and brown dwarfs or black holes. These are all things that we know exist, but other evidence suggests that most dark matter probably isn't in the form of MACHOs (such as microlensing surveys). There's also the fact that the CMB and big bang nucleosynthesis suggest that dark matter is not baryonic, which means it couldn't be MACHOs other than a special type of black hole called primordial black holes which hypothetically may have formed in the very early universe.",no,view comment

> How do you explain the CMB power spectrum and BBN then?

CMB PS: as a surface measurement (last scattering), not a depth measurement (perfectly smooth *volume* at inflation), of the early universe.  As such, third bump can be interpreted in several ways.  One might be primordial but not remnant.

Further conundrums are that it doesn't clump, but it does, but not where we look, but also, not where we are.  It's critical to galaxies, but the more young ones and GCs we find, and the better instruments we use, the more we find them just devoid of the gravitational evidence of any dark matter at all.

Remember, ?CDM is predicated also on homogeneity and isotropy, both of which are challenged by some of the very observations we have supporting DM/DE.

38,,budrap00,17/01/2022,-2,,-2,"Science does not deal in proof, only in evidence. There is no empirical evidence for the existence of dark matter. It is a free parameter that was added to the standard model of cosmology originally to account for the flat rotation curves of galaxies. Being a free parameter it was found to be useful in any situation where the the math of General Relativity failed to account for observations at galactic scale and beyond.

The mathematical formalism (field equations) of GR was developed in the context of the solar system at a time (1905-1915) when the known extent of the Cosmos was essentially the Milky Way. The GR equations have never worked well at galactic and above scales, but since it was assumed that the math constituted a Universal Law, it was observed reality that was deemed deficient. Dark matter was conceived to correct for one such deficiency.

The problem is that math is not science. Science is the study of those things that can be observed and measured; mathematics is a set of logical formalisms based on counting. Math is a useful and essential tool of science, but it is only a tool; it is not science. 

Modern cosmology has developed into a cult whose practitioners hold the unscientific belief that their mathematical model determines the nature of physical reality when the opposite should be the case - their math should *reflect* the nature of *observed* physical reality.

As a consequence of their unscientific belief in the primacy of mathematical models, proponents of the Big Bang model insist that there exists, not only dark matter, but dark energy, a universal inflation event, expanding space, and a universal framework such that the entirety of the Cosmos - both observed and unobserved - was once upon a time simultaneously compressed into a volume smaller than a gnat's ass.

None of those beliefs are supported by any direct empirical evidence. All of the so-called evidence for those beliefs consists of model-dependent inferences such that the entirety of the model comprises a particularly baroque example of circular reasoning. *The model is correct, therefore all the undetectable objects and events the model requires in order to be correct must exist because the model is correct.* That is unscientific nonsense and modern cosmology is an unscientific mess.

That the Big Bang model is a failure is, in itself, not a scientific disgrace. Science essentially proceeds by trial and error. The problem with the Big Bang model is that despite its obvious and undeniable incongruence with physical reality, it remains the only cosmological model under consideration by cosmologists of the scientific academy. Both research funding and academic publication are controlled by members of the Big Bang cult and no models are permitted that aren't based on the fundamental *expanding universe* premise that underlies the Big Bang fantasy. 

The current situation is a scientific disgrace but nothing will change until the Big Bang cult's stranglehold on research funding and publication is broken. Until that happens modern cosmology will remain a simplistic belief system devoid of any scientific credibility.",no,view comment
39,,budrap00,21/01/2022,2,,2,"The only purpose of dark matter is to reconcile the standard model of cosmology with observations. That's it, there is no empirical evidence for the existence DM. This situation exists because of a naive belief that our gravitational models (Newtonian or General Relativity) that were derived in the context of the solar system should work equally well on  vastly larger and more complex systems like galaxies and galaxy clusters. They don't.

All the so-called evidence for DM amounts to its ability to be deployed in any quantity in any location to make the SMoC agree with observations. DM is essentially all purpose gravitational fairy dust.  The reason DM is so good at this is because its properties have been defined down to something that makes the model work without having any bothersome properties that might make it directly detectable. 

DM is like quarks for cosmology, something that has to be there for the model to work but due to its failure to appear in observed reality it has been necessary to assign DM the property of invisibility (transparent to electromagnetic radiation). 

The case of quarks is handled somewhat differently (quark confinement) but the end result is the same, necessary components of the model that can't be empirically demonstrated to exist are simply declared impervious to direct detection.

To me, it simply seems just as likely to be that we do not fully understand a fundamental aspect of physics, rather than an undetectable physical matter with mass is floating randomly through our universe. 

  
Dark matter attempts to expain, when we use our currently accepted physics equations, the unexpected gravitation rotations of galaxies. It does so by saying there must be some sort of hidden mass creating extra gravity which is causing these rotational anomolies. 

  
Alternative gravity theories such as MOND (which may or may not be correct, and are likely not fully develped) are saying there is something we do not fully understand with the laws of physics and the universe, and this misunderstanding is causing these rotational anomlies.  


Some people say dark matter is simply a placeholder for what is causing rotational anomalies, but it becomes more of a muddied water as some say there is some sort of physical matter causing these gravitational anomolies. 

  
However, that physical matter has never actuallly been detected, despite millions of dollars in experiments. If you fall in to this category, you are essentially saying an undetectable particle (so far) with mass, causes the gravitational anomolies and our current understanding of general realitivity and gravity formulas are correct. This is the most popular theory, but it is just that. A theory is valid until it is disproven.
