2,,internetboyfriend666,05/04/22,7,,7,"We're not really sure. Dark matter is some ""stuff"" in the universe that interacts gravitationally but as far as we can tell doesn't interact electromagnetically at all. In other words, we can see that it's there by its gravitational effects, but we can't actually see it directly with light. For lack of a better term, it's ""invisible."" We don't really know for sure what it is but we suspect it's some kind of particle that we haven't discovered yet.",no,view comment
3,,Caucasiafro,05/04/22,12,,12,"It's matter we can't see. Beyond that we have no idea what it is (or if it even exists in the first place as far as I know).

And when I say ""see"" I mean we have not figured out a way to detect its presence directly at all. Like air is matter that is invisible to your eyes but we have other devices we can use to ""see"" it because air still interacts with light. Dark matter doesn't interact with light at all.

We think dark matter exists is because we can model the universe and it's not behaving the way we think it should based on all the mass we can see, it's acting like there's a lot more mass there. So we think it's dark matter",no,view comment

5,,[deleted],05/04/22,3,,3,The Dark in Dark Matter is there because dark implies that we can't actually see it.  Since we can't see it we don't know what it is.  All we can do is measure the gravitational effects that it has on things like galaxies.,no,view comment
6,,StupidLemonEater,05/04/22,3,,3,"Nobody knows what dark matter is. Nobody's ever observed it, which is why it's called ""dark.""

We only think it exists because our observations of things like galaxies do not square with our equations and models of how they should behave. The only way it works is if there's a lot more mass out there than we can see.

Some physicists don't believe that dark matter exists, they think all of our equations and models are wrong, and are proposing different laws of physics that might explain the universe.",no,view comment

8,,Caucasiafro,05/04/22,6,,6,"A lot of things in the universe behave certain ways based on how heavy they are.

Like a galaxy will spin at a certain rate based on it's mass (I can't remember if it spins faster or slower if it's heavier).

We see how fast those galaxies are spinning and our math comes out wrong.

Now, the reason we don't just go ""well, I guess our equations are just BS"" is that those equations work for like...everything else.

It's entirely possible our understanding of gravity is just completely wrong; but it's just as likely, if not more so, that we just can't see all the matter.",no,view comment
9,,[deleted],05/04/22,6,,6,"Stars don't move in spiral galaxies as we would expect from all the matter we can observe in the galaxies.  For instance, you would expect that the further out stars are in a galaxy the slower they would orbit around the galaxy as there is more mass towards the centre of the galaxy.  In fact, spiral galaxies have a central bulge of a lot of mass. Instead, you see basically the same orbital velocity no matter how far out the stars are.  This implies that there's some sort of extra mass around the galaxies that keeps the further out stars moving so fast.",no,view comment
10,,RhynoD,05/04/22,4,,4,"> Like a galaxy will spin at a certain rate based on it's mass (I can't remember if it spins faster or slower if it's heavier).

Faster. Higher gravity pulls mass inward so it must spin faster to stay in orbit (at the same distance).

Another piece of evidence is gravitational lensing, where gravity from a galaxy will bend light much like a lens. The amount that the light changes path depends on the mass, and what is observed is more lensing than can be accounted for based on the visible matter.",yes,view comment
11,,RhynoD,05/04/22,5,,5,"Specifically why dark matter is called ""dark"" comes from the original theory that the mass that couldn't be accounted for might be coming from literally dark stuff. Stars are *super* visible. Our own sun accounts for 99.8% of mass in our solar system. It stands to reason that if you count all the stars and know how massive they are, you should be able to get a very reasonable approximation of the mass in a galaxy. Since that is *not* the case, the idea was that the extra mass might be from lots of dust and large planets and all that other *not star* matter that is literally too dark to see.

Well, more surveys and better telescopes ruled that out. In fact, as astrophysicists looked harder, they found that there vastly more dark matter than regular matter in the universe. Even being *super* generous about how much *not star* stuff there is, it simply can't be enough to make up for the huge discrepancy. Another ""dark"" idea was black holes of various sizes, but that has been mostly ruled out as well.

So although the name ""dark"" matter stuck, it doesn't have anything to do with visible light - except that we know that whatever it is, it doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force at all (or so weakly that it might as well be not at all), so it *is* literally dark. It seems that whatever dark matter is, it doesn't interact with *any* of the forces other than gravity, and even then it's very weak. The reason it has such a strong impact is that there's just so much of it. So ""dark"" in this context really means ""unknown.""

That concept of ""dark = unknown"" is where the name ""dark energy"" comes from. Dark energy has nothing to do with dark matter (probably) but, like dark matter, no one knows what it actually is, yet, so it is ""dark"".",yes,view comment
12,,OrionLax,06/04/22,2,,2,"We can see how it affects things through gravity. That's the reason we even think it's a thing.

It's like how black holes are completely invisible, but you can ""see"" it due to its strong gravity. You can see a big black sphere inside the event horizon, the distorted light due to gravitational lensing and other objects orbiting it, like an accretion disk.",no,view comment
