13,,Warpine,14/10/22,8,,8,"Here's a counterpoint entirely unrelated to dark matter & dark energy:

There are two groups of theories that produce the strongest predictive power & most accurately model our universe: Quantum Field Theories and General & Special relativity

Quantum theories arose because of a glaring issue back in the late 19th century, dramatically called the ""Ultraviolet catastrophe"". We had these really great equations for describing blackbody radiation that physically made sense, but when you summed up all of the light emitted by a blackbody, it.. blew up into infinity. Needless to say, blackbodies did not radiate away infinite light

It wasn't until a smart cookie by the name of Max Planck offhandedly quantized the frequency of light (which is also to quantize a photon's energy) (to quantize is to break into discrete chunks; the frequency of light was being treated as a continuum until this point). 

Lo and behold, after tuning the size of these quanta, the equation for blackbody radiation matched ***exactly*** to the real world. This newly tuned quanta has since been proven to physically real - photons ***MUST*** take on integer multiples of this fundamental minimum frequency. There is literally no photon possible that can take on, for example, 2.5 times this smallest energy packet

So anyway, that's the origin story of one of the most successful theories in modern physics. In short, all of quantum mechanics came about because Planck was making the math work",no,view comment

Now, regarding dark matter. Scientists have detected, and verified, that the motion of large celestial objects (clusters, galaxies...) move in ways that don't fit our gravitational models.

This can be explained in two ways. The first is a yet undiscovered piece of the puzzle, the second is that our gravitational models are wrong.

Dark matter is the name given to that undetected force. The properties of this unknown piece are that it affects the gravitational field, but not the EM field.

The alternative solution needs to explain how galaxies are exerting WAY more force than their mass would allow, which would be a few orders of magnitude more bizarre than matter that doesn't interact with the EM field since we know of several particles that behave this way (e.g. Neutrinos)",no,view comment

Invisible and undetectable **to our instruments from our point of measurement but affecting universe in exact way that fits our models**. You omitted quite an important part. No matter how advanced we seem, many parts of astrophysics rely on math because we are unable to get good observations and measurements because we are but a bunch of people on one planet in one solar system trying to discover universe via tools that are limited. It's like astronomers of Renaissance creating theories based on observations available via primitive telescopes only.

Dark Matter is currently the prevailing theory because it explains best observations that we are able to be made. 

>This seems highly unlikely

Why? We are able to create pigments that absorb [nearly all visible light](https://youtu.be/p6q54q2iam8?t=284) which produces effect that we would tell is highly unlikely. We know there are materials that block radiation So why this is so unlikely that outside our solar system there is matter that we are unable to direcly detect?

That's exactly what dark matter is. The way it was discovered is because we couldn't explain the gravitational forces of the parts of the universe that are seemingly ""empty"". Or rather the galaxies are influenced gravitationally by something that we have no way to explain by using the current-day theory of gravity. The edges of huge galactic constellations for example should be traveling slower than those near center, yet they travel at almost the exact same speeds which should be impossible. So we have 2 options:

1, There is something there that we just cannot detect right now. This thing has to consist of some sort of particles that don't interact with visible light in a conventional way.

2, Our theory of gravity is incorrect and/or not all-encompassing and we have to modify it in order to adjust for this anomaly.

Both options have some things going for them. 

The first option (dark matter is real) the influences of ""the alleged"" dark matter are consistent with a cosmological constant which is sort of a mathematical bandaid describing sort of (negative energy) that Einstein hypothesized but discarded later.

And the second option (dark matter is not real, our understanding id flawed) could be true because we do actually have mathematical models of gravity that would adjust for this anomaly. We just don't know how to make it fit with the rest of our physics.",no,view comment

It could be a force we haven't discovered,  some kind of matter we haven't accounted for, or we could not have the computing power for fully calculate all of the interactions due to gravity present in that size of a system.

I mean the only way I could possibly engage with this is to point out that the simple fact we cannot detect it proves it's currently undetectable.  It's UFO logic - the fact we can't identify the object means it's unidentified.

It would no longer be undetectable.  And by developing a method of detecting it, we'd probably learn a hell of a lot about what it is.

But we can measure the expansion of the universe and develop a mass of the universe based on changes in rate in expansion, and that math is not off by a factor of fucking 20.

59,,TryNeat7519,17/10/22,1,,1,"My hypothesis is that ""dark matter"" is the quantifiable effect of the warping of space time between objects. While the gravitational interactions of various galaxies are the same based on calculated mass, the warping of space time isn't. This effect causes the inertia we call ""dark matter"" between objects to compound and radiate out, which explains the less rotational variation from the  center of a galaxy to be more aligned to the outer radius. This also explains the oddities that are Ulta diffuse galaxies and lack of dark matter contained within. While the mass is the same as other galaxies, and so is the gravitational interaction as a whole, the warping of space time is not.",no,view comment
60,,TransientLunatic_,24/10/22,1,,1,"There are many physicists currently attempting to create revised equations of gravity to account for the problems that Dark Matter solves. This approach is called MOND (MOdified Newtonian Dynamics), and as of yet has fallen much shorter of explaining what we see then Dark Matter theories.

I’m particular, while MOND can be fine-tuned to predict galaxy rotations, it can’t explain our observations of things such as the Bullet Cluster, or any other place where the ratio of concentration of visible to dark matter is different. Or rather, if it is modified to solve these problems, then it no longer accurately reflects the rotation of galaxies. Dark matter, on the other hand, explains these multiple separate observations simultaneously.

In the Bullet Cluster, we see the aftermath of two galaxy clusters colliding. If MOND were correct and not DM, all of the gravitation lensing would be observed around the visible matter. MOND changes how gravity behaves over cosmic distances, but it remains an outwardly radiating force from all mass. However, our observations of gravitational lensing indicate that the centers of mass are not in the same places where all of the visible matter is.

The way these centers of invincible mass seem to have moved since the collision do match the description of dark matter as a particle that interacts only with gravity, however; visible mass clumps up into solar systems and black holes, while dark matter remains diffuse and passes through itself.

Another example is the galaxy NGC-1052-DF2, which appears to lack dark matter; it’s rotation shows that it’s total mass is roughly the same as it’s visible mass, unlike most galaxies which have total masses far above their visible masses. It would be very difficult for a set of MOND equations to explain this, because MOND theories would require galaxies with the same amounts of visible mass to have the same amounts of total mass.

In a similar vein, there are regions of space empty of visible matter that nonetheless exhibit strong gravitational lensing, indicating a high concentration of dark matter. This is also difficult for MOND approaches to explain.

As for the properties of dark matter itself, the most obvious characteristic is that it interacts neither with electromagnetism nor with the nuclear forces. While this might sound far-fetched, we do know of particles that don’t interact with these forces already; Neutrinos and Higgs bosons play a role in the weak force, but do not interact with electromagnetism or the strong force (which is why they too can pass through visible matter mostly uninhibited like dark matter is meant to). While neither of these is a suitable dark matter candidate for a variety of reasons, they show how some very non-interactive particles can exist.

Essentially, we have tons of evidence for some kind of weakly interacting massive particle that generates a lot of the gravitational force we see on the largest cosmic scales. When scientists talk about detecting dark matter on Earth, they mean building extremely sensitive instruments to see the infinitesimally tiny gravitational tugs caused by individual dark matter particles passing through patches of visible matter. This is very similar to what we had to do to detect the neutrino, but much more difficult and precise; we used the weak force to detect neutrinos, but are relying on gravity (which is ironically much weaker then the weak force) for dark matter, so the sensitivity must be much higher.

As a disclaimer, I’m an interested layman, not an astrophysicist myself, so it is very possible I’ve presented an incomplete summation of the state of the field.",no,view comment
