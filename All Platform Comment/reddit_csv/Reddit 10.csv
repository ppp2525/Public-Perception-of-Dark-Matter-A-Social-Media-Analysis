3,,[deleted],07/03/18,4805,,4805,"We can calculate things like gravity and energy density of the universe base on how the galaxies behave on a cosmic scale.  We can also calculate how much stuff is out there by direct observation.  When we look at the cosmos and look at how the galaxies behave, there is not enough material to generate the gravity (even when accounting for all the gas and dust that may obscuring it).  So there's some matter that doesn't emit light but still generates that gravity we see.  We call it dark matter, because that's what it is: dark.

There's also an expansion to the universe that suggests that the energy density is not what we can directly measure.  There's a bunch of stuff out there causing the universe to expand at an accelerated rate.  We call it dark energy, because, hey, we have dark matter already--why not call it ""Dark Energy""; that way it sounds cool.

So there's like 5 times as much matter as what we can see, and like 3 times as much energy density as what can be explained by that matter.  So that's where the percentages come from: just add up all the stuff we know about that makes up the universe even if we don't yet know what that stuff is.",no,view comment

A absolute disproving of dark matter would likely lead us to throw out most of modern astrophysics. As you might imagine, this would also be pretty hard to accomplish, what with it not reacting to light and all.

These kinds of additions have been revoked before, though. Aether was introduced into early scientific models to give light a material to travel through (much like sound and other waves need). The famous ""Michelson–Morley experiment"" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment)) showed this couldn't be the case, and so science moved on to realize that Light was made of Photons and therefore didn't need a material to transmit.

9,,PLTuck,07/03/18,78,,78,"Dark matter and Dark energy are two very different things. It's like comparing apples and oranges.

So, lets deal with matter first. The combined mass of all the stars in the milky way accounts for around 10% of the mass of the Milky Way. All of the dust and gas clouds account for around 10% of that. So the mass of the milky way is ~89% Dark matter.  Planets aren't included in the calculation, as the total planetary mass would be insignificant at the orders of magnitude of mass being discussed.

So what is dark matter? We have no idea. Although it sounds very sinister, it's called dark simply because we cant see it.

Dark energy is the energy that is making the space between our galaxy clusters expand at faster than the speed of light, and increasing. If there was no such thing, the expansion would be slowing down, or the universe would be contracting under gravity.

Without trying to be rude, I don't think you are aware. If you were, this question answers itself.

Dark matter for example is simply a name for of mass that we can't see inside a galaxy but we know must be there. We know it must be there because of how fast the galaxy is rotating, and how much gravity must therefore be present to cause it to rotate that fast (not enough gravity and everything would fly apart).

In other words that's how we learned dark matter exists in the first place. We calculated the amount of matter we can see and it's not 100% of the matter we know must be there because of the rotation, so the remaining percentage we say is dark matter.",no,view comment

24,,PLTuck,08/03/18,39,,39,"Ah I see.

OK so to calculate the total mass in the Milky Way, we use a formula called the galactic rotation curve which allows the enclosed mass inside any distance in parsecs to be calculated.

The equation is actually quite simple ,and is based on Newtons 2nd Law of motion, and Newton's law of gravitation.

M = ( v^2 R)/G

M = mass,
v=orbital speed,
R=radius, and 
G=universal gravitational constant (6.673x10^26 N m^2 kg^-2 )

By plotting these rotation curves for various distances on a logarithmic scale graph, we can see that a considerable amount of matter actually extends out beyond the visible galactic disc. The only thing is, we haven't observed it, at any wavelength.

Dark matter is almost the opposite. We have a theory of gravity. We have observations based on that theory of gravity. There is a disparity between those observations that is not accounted for by what we know about. So we give that disparity a name. ""Dark matter"" is the name given to a gap in our theoretical models that we know about because of experimental observations.

28,,rubicube1,08/03/18,14,,14,"There are several answers giving our estimate for dark matter within a galaxy using rotation curves, which is true.  But overall in the universe, our estimate comes from the scale of the fluctuations of energy density in the early universe.  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is radiation left over from the period in the universe when the temperature finally fell just enough for electrons to join with nucleons to become atoms, and with no more free charged particles, photons became free to travel in the universe.  What we can do is look at the CMB radiation and map the scale of energy fluctuations over very large scales in the early universe.  There were several forces at play determining the shape of these fluctuations.  Gravitation tried to pull things together, whereas radiation pressure pushed things apart, and the curvature of the universe played a role.  If you plot the angular power spectrum of the CMB, as a functino of the multipole moment, you get a multi humped shape, and these humps gives us information about the shape of the universe (essentially flat, which gives us information about dark energy) and the ratio of matter not experiencing pressure (dark matter) to regular matter.

30,,Aeellron,08/03/18,12,,12,"Basically from gravitational equations.

The famous 'discovery' of dark matter is from astronomers measuring the rotational velocities of stars in a galaxy. 

When you look at planets orbiting the sun the inner planets orbit much faster than the outer planets. We expected to measure the same kind of difference in speeds of stars in a disc galaxy (like our own). We did not.

Instead they found that the outer stars are basically going the same speed as the inner stars. Almost like the entire visible galaxy was actually set in an invisible sphere and the spheres' rotational velocity was essentially the rotational velocity for the entire system. (Think about one of those cool hand-blown glass marbles and how the designs inside all rotate around the center at the same rate).

The only solutions, mathematically, that fit the observed data are: our formula for gravity is wrong (it might be, but it's far too predictively accurate to be off by enough to account for these observations) or, there's a whole lot more mass than we can see in the system.

By 'can't see' scientists basically mean 'non-interacting' with other matter. So they crunch the numbers to figure out how much mass the dark matter is compared to normal matter (x% normal matter + y% dark matter = z rotational velocity). This is where the percentages come in and therein is the answer to your question.

Dark energy is a little different but also kind of similar. Instead of using gravitational measurements we made velocity measurements of red-shift (talking about the expansion of spacetime  with respect to entropy) and found our x% normal energies did not equal the z velocities that we observe. Again, crunch some numbers and solve for the unknown y% dark energy and bam.

37,,ps311,08/03/18,127,,127,"For dark matter and ordinary matter, we basically measure the *total* matter first (since it all gravitates the same), then differentiate between the two using a second effect. 

The total matter (23%+5%=28%) is roughly given by the ratio of heights of the first and third peaks in the [Cosmic Microwave Background angular powerspectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#/media/File:PowerSpectrumExt.svg) because the third peak mostly evolved (by gravity) when the matter content of the universe was negligible, and the first peak mostly evolved when the universe was matter dominated. So the third peak is kind of a calibrator letting the first peak tells you how much matter there is.

To differentiate just the ""ordinary matter"" part, you can get that from the CMB too, but an even cooler way is by measuring how much of various atomic elements there are in the universe in little pockets that appear to have been pristinely left from the Big Bang. In these pockets, you see that something like 24% of the atoms are Helium-4. The amount of Helium-4 formed by the Big Bang depends really sensitively on how much ordinary matter there was, i.e. the ordinary atoms that are the building blocks of Helium. Run the math and that 24% number tells you about 5% of the universe is normal matter. Then 28%-5% and you get the part which is ""missing"", i.e. dark matter. 

As for dark energy, well we've just measured how much matter there is (I actually cheated a bit above, those things tells you the total amount of matter, not the percentage relative to everything), so we can calculate how much all that matter gravitating in on itself should slow the expansion of the universe. Then you go and measure the expansion and find, lo-and-behold, not only is the expansion not slowing, its accelerating! Using supernovae as beacons to precisely measure the acceleration rate, you work out how much dark energy there is, giving you that 72% number.

There's probably like 10 other ways to measure these things than what I just described, cosmologists are constantly looking for new ways to do so and comparing the answers against each other, in hope to find a crack in the model pointing to some new things we don't understand!

43,,CyberneticPanda,08/03/18,29,,29,"It's almost certainly not one single thing. There are weakly interacting particles that were once thought to be massless and now believed to have mass like [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino). Part of the mass that we can't find is neutrinos, because they are very difficult to detect. There have been simulations where the missing mass is all neutrinos, but they don't match with what we see in the real world, so neutrinos can't be the only explanation. Small dark bodies like asteroids could be an explanation for part of it too, but again, simulations that have the entire amount of missing mass made of small cold rocks don't match observations, plus the extra mass doesn't seem to be concentrated in the galactic disk, like rocky material orbiting the galaxy would be expected to do. 

So ""dark matter"" is sort of a catchall term for all of the stuff contributing to gravity that we have not yet identified, and the amount of it required means that some of it is likely to be some sort of exotic matter that we haven't seen yet, since simulations using stuff we have seen don't fit observations.",no,view comment
44,,sterexx,08/03/18,25,,25,"Usually to understand what something is, we need to subject it to many different situations to see how it reacts. That's how you learn more about something.

But particles only interact using four fundamental forces/interactions, and not all particles are affected by all forces. It is usually easier for us to inspect something with the electromagnetic interaction (light, magnetic fields, etc) than with gravity, because of the precision it affords us. We can still detect some things with gravity, like satellites detecting minute changes based on flying over mountain ranges or using LIGO to detect black hole mergers.

But so far we only know dark matter by its gravity. It won't emit light or interact excitingly with other objects in space. With black holes we had predictions about their existence before we ever found any and they have very acutely powerful gravitational interactions which let us both detect mergers and see powerful local effects on other stellar objects and accreting gas/dust. But dark matter is very diffuse, affecting only on large scales.

So it's not that we don't have the equipment, exactly. We don't know what will let us get a closer look, if anything.

Neutrinos I believe were predicted to exist (because they filled a missing spot in the math) and postulated as a dark matter candidate, but I believe they were also predicted to interact via the weak nuclear interaction, which meant if you tried long enough to hit it directly with other matter, you might. And we eventually did. Iirc we then discovered they were not massive enough to account for dark matter. I hope I have the order right here.

So when you have predictions about what you're looking for, it makes it easier. With dark matter, we don't have much to go on, and the one way we know it interacts (gravity) isn't a good way of getting a close look at something so diffuse.

52,,TitaniumDragon,08/03/18,32,,32,"Dark Energy has a reasonably high chance of being some sort of error.

Dark Matter, however, has been indirectly observed in the form of gravitational lensing, the structure of some galaxies, and in a few cases, we've seen dark matter which is disconnected from ordinary matter (i.e. a galaxy where the dark matter distribution is off from the visible matter distribution).

Thus, either dark matter exists in some form, or we're grossly wrong about how gravity works on a macroscopic scale.

One issue with dark matter is that the more local you get, the harder it is to detect dark matter - some studies indicate that the local density of dark matter has to be well below what it ""should"" be. If that is indeed the case, we might have a real problem, as if it is only something that doesn't appear nearby, that might be an indication of something being off in our observations of more distance objects; however, this idea is disputed by other studies.

Dark Energy, conversely, is more or less ""the macroscopic scale of the universe is wrong unless we add in this other factor"". It would not be in the least bit surprising to discover that Dark Energy is the result of some sort of either systematic misunderstanding of how the universe works, or a systematic error in our estimation of the distance of distance objects or something similar (for instance, that some ""standard candle"" we're using isn't actually standard or is multiple kinds of objects, creating a systematic bias in our distance calculations which is creating the illusion of dark energy).",no,view comment

The phenomena you're referencing is called [modified newtonian dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics). While this question is still certainly open for debate, the general consensus within the field has shifted to the point where we almost certainly believe this is a particle and not some unknown property of gravity. There are many reasons for this, but my favorite and probably the most straight forward comes from our observations of the Bullet Cluster. 

Take a look at this [graphic by NASA](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094). The pink represents where most of the 'normal' matter is. Loose gas, stars, etc. The blue represents where most of the *gravity* is in the photo. Even though you can't see the mass directly, it warps and distorts our image of the galaxies behind it by a phenomena known as gravitational lensing, which can be preciously measured. When these two clusters collided, all of the gas got slowed down as the galaxies began to interact and merge. However, since dark matter doesn't interact with normal matter very easily (otherwise we would have detected it by now), it flows right through. MOND simply doesn't have an elegant solution to this while the dark matter model does.

If a single rain drop hits that pool is causes a [circular ripple](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWFL6.jpg). By looking at how that ripple propagates through the water you can learn about the water. For instance, the pattern of the thicker circles and narrower circles tells us about the phase velocity and group velocity of water waves. Importantly (for the analogy), if you drop this pool of water (making it essentially weightless), you would remove the restoring force that makes the wave propagate and you would see the ripple stationary on the surface of water. 

Now imagine that there isn't just one rain drop, but many rain drops falling on the surface of the water. You drop this pool of water, making it weightless, and you see a messy pattern frozen on the surface caused by the interference of all the water waves with each other. But, if you take all the high points in this mess of water and  superimpose them on top of each other you would get an image that, on average, looks like single a circular ripple of water. You can then do the same analysis you would with a single drop of water to learn about the water itself. 

We do a very similar analysis to find out the composition of the universe. At one point the universe was dense, and all the matter and energy was sloshing around inside an expanding universe. These are called baryon acoustic oscillations. However, at some point the universe cooled and became sparse enough that it stopped sloshing around because it couldn't interact with itself any more. The restoring force for the sloshing was removed, or the ""pool was dropped"". The remnants of this is called the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is analogous to the frozen pattern of raindrops on our weightless pool. 

The CMB is a measure of how much matter there is in a part of the universe. If you take all the hot spots (and cold spots), with lots of matter (and little matter), and superimpose them on top of each other we get a [pattern very similar to the ripples in water](http://inspirehep.net/record/1224727/files/Figs_spots_pol_stacks30.png). By studying the peaks of those patterns we can lean about the type of matter and energy that caused the ripple. In that image the measured data are on the top and the bottom is what we get from the best fit model (LCDM a model with cold dark matter and dark energy) that tells the the numerical values for the normal matter/dark matter/dark energy composition of the universe that you mention in your question.

We know^1 the universe has at least three components we can measure (matter, light, and curvature) and one that we can't (Lambda/dark energy). These quantities are related via the Friedman Equation such that

Omega_matter + Omega_light + Omega_Lambda = 1 - Omega_curvature

The three terms on the left can be written as Omega_Naught, so this is often written

Omega_Naught = 1 - Omega_curvature

Today, the energy density in light (via photons) is essentially zero (~1e-5 ), so we'll discount it for now. The total matter density is measured directly from the power spectrum of the CMB and is 28.6% with visible matter only contributing 4.6%- the rest is in dark matter. We have measured the curvature to be 0 to within a few parts in a thousand (from the Planck satellite) and the ESA's Euclid mission will likely affirm this to an even greater precision. That means the above equation reduces to

Omega_Naught = 1

or

Omega_Lambda = 1.0 - 0.286 = 0.714.

Even if Omega_Lambda isn't Einstein's Lambda, it has to be something that accounts for the remaining energy density and causes the acceleration of the universe.

126,,klesto92,08/03/18,36,,36,"I actually wrote about this during the last bit of my degree in physics. I would link it to you but a) it’s a bit complicated for non physicists and b) it’s in spanish. So let me explain it as clear as I can:

As you may or may not know we use General Relativity to study cosmology. The usual model uses the FLRW solution to Einstein’s field equations(EFE). This solution is used for a homogeneous and isotropic space-time (that basically means the contento of matter/energy is the same everywhere and in all directions). So the equations that stem from the EFE using this solution do not t fully describe the behavior of space-time, we need something else: A content inside this universe. For this the simplest model to use is a fluid (a perfect fluid, a fluid which has some properties that make it easier to use than a more real fluid). When you look at galaxies in a sufficiently big scale, they can be modeled using a perfect fluid. Now we can work using the EFE and the equation for the fluid to have a description of the evolution of the universe. 

So suppose we have the usual stuff that we know: matter and light (yes, light can be modeled as a fluid). We do a study using these two fluids and... we arrive at the conclusion that the universe is expanding but it is expanding slower every time. But then we have a problem, we observe the universe and we find that the prediction of the model is wrong and the expansion of the universe is accelerating. We need more matter/energy in the universe for this to happen so we take another usual model called: ?CDM (a model with Cosmological Constant (or Dark Energy) and Cold Dark Matter) and we test it and we see that it makes a much better adjustment to the equations. From this we infer that we have around 30% of CDM and 70% of ?.

You might still be wondering how we arrive at these numbers, I haven’t explained that yet. So now I’ll do it.

To perform the studies I roughly mentioned above we use data from a particular type of supernovae: supernovae type Ia. This kind of supernovae emit a pretty standardized amount of light and energy. So the data used is something called “distance modulus” it’s some kind of comparison between absolute and apparent magnitudes (the apparent measures the brightness of the object how we perceive it and the other measures how bright it would be at 10 parcecs away from us). This quantity is linked with the distance by a little equation. And the other data needed is the reshift of the object (basically how far away it would be, or how “red” it’s light appears to be due to its relative motion from us because of the expanding universe). We have this observational data captured from huge supernovae samplings. And we have the equations that give us a theoretical expression (an expression that has Dark Energy, CDM and redshift as parameters) for the distance modulus. 

Now for getting those numbers we need to make a statistical study if said data. We “compare” the data with the theoretical input and try to minimize the difference with the observational data of the distance modulus of the supernovae. What we do is we sample a lot of values for Dark Energy and CDM and obtain a range of values using a Markov Chain in the Metropolis-Hastings method (at least that’s what I did), obviously we use a computer for this. We input some arbitrary values for DE and CDM we make a comparison between the calculated distance modulus using these values and the observational data then we put some conditions that make the program make the decision if that value is useful or not and if it is it keeps it and if it’s not it “walks a new step” (that is it defines a new value for DE and CDM) and once again the program tests if these new values for DE and CDM are useful or not and so on until the program finishes the amount of steps we want it to take. We end up with a bunch of chains made of different values for DE and CDM. We plot some histograms and take the averages and what would you know, the averages are the 30% and 70% you know about. Does that mean that’s what the universe is made of? No. In this case the averages are also the values of DE and CDM that are most likely in our universe. 


I hope this helps you understand a bit more on what is actually done in this type of research and I really hope you read my comment because it took me like half an hour or more to write. If you have any questions you can ask me and I’ll gladly try to answer them.

Edit: I messed up a bit (not counting all the typos) where I said you need a content for the EFE to be useful. That’s not entirely true, once you have the perfect fluid (in this case) there’s still something missing for the equations to be useful, we need more information about the fluid: the Equation of State. It’s a relation between several thermodynamical properties but in the case of a simple fluid used in cosmology we only need an equation that relates the pressure of the fluid p and it’s energy density ?

There are a couple of ways we think we know how DM is distributed. The first is through the direct observations we can make in the universe of the gravitational effects. The presence of matter and thus gravity naturally effects how things move or rotate, and how fast; so from the scale of stars to galaxies to groups and clusters of galaxies, we can build up a working picture, combined with gravitational lensing that sometimes gives us a very accurate measure. The second is from simulations - there is a big industry in cosmology building big simulations of the evolution of matter on enormous scales over billions of years, and from this we can get a decent picture of how [matter on large scales](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/the-beautiful-complexity-of-the-cosmic-web/) ends up at the present day.  

As for how uniform it is, well we know it's in spherical clumps (we call them halos since they surround galaxies and clusters); we have some [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro%E2%80%93Frenk%E2%80%93White_profile) derived from observation that describe how they get denser towards the middle and more tenuous at the edges. We also know these clumps draw together and merge over the history of the universe.

*Edited to add:* Where is it - yes, our galaxy like all others sits in a dark matter halo, and most of the matter in the universe is dark matter, so finding some would seem to be easy. As for whether we could we study a particle - we have a few ideas and experiments trying to detect whether they interact with normal matter even a tiny bit, but so far finding a way to actually study one and figure out its properties eludes us.

That means, in one orbit it goes 1.66 the distance Earth does.  But the actual time it takes is 1.88 years instead of 1.66 years.  That is because being farther from the Sun, Mars needs to go SLOWER to stay in its orbit (and not fall into the Sun or fly away).

At a galaxy level though, this is not what is observed.  The equivalent of Mars needs to go faster, and have a 1.66 years orbit instead of 1.88 years. It needs to go faster because there is more mass, and this mass is distributed weirdly (as if there was another part of the Sun somewhere between Earth and Mars).  This mass gives no light and does not seem to interact with regular matter in any way.  This is Dark Matter.

Dark Energy is more along the lines of  /r/blackmagicfuckery.

145,,GreatBigBagOfNope,08/03/18,5,,5,"So this is actually a legitimate idea about a potential end of the universe, called the **False Vacuum**.

The first thing to understand is that things in the universe like being at low energy. That is, in some intuitive sense, why things like falling into gravitational wells, or why springs enjoy being at their preferred length. (Side note: a key component of the energy of a thing is the **potential**. For gravity, far away the potential is about 0, but it lowers and lowers and lowers as you get closer, and objects want to ""fall"" down this hole. How fast they do fall down depends on how fast they were going before, and how steep the slope of the ""hole"" is)

Quantum Field Theory (sorry) is a theory which attempts (quite successfully - as in, it's the most successful theory ever made, even more so than GR) to push bits and bobs of Special Relativity (SR) into Quantum Mechanics (QM). A consequence of QFT is that there exist **fields** that permeate the entire universe, and things that we know of as electrons, photons, quarks, bosons, everything, are **excitations** of these fields. An electron is a little bump in the electron field, and a photon is a little bump in the EM field. Quarks are a lot harder, but they are still bumps in a field.

Because **maths**, the energy density of the field (amount of energy per volume) is a function of the field (you have a location, you plug the *value* of the field into a number cruncher, and you get a number at the end which is an energy density). This energy density *function* has a minimum point, which the fields typically sit at, because things like being at low energy. But, *what if* there is another minimum? Some other value of the field which produces a lower energy density? Thanks to quantum tunnelling, there is a nonzero probability that the field will just find itself able to descend to this new minimum energy density (again, sorry for the geometric metaphors but if you look at the graphs it genuinely looks like things are falling down holes). 

So what happens when the field finds the new minimum? The bits of field that are nearby will find out very quickly, because the information about this new minimum will spread at the speed of light away from the point where it was first 'discovered'. An expanding sphere of influence will grow into the universe, a boundary where within its reach, the laws of physics of the outside have absolutely no say. Every bit of matter, dark matter, energy, dark energy it touches will be consumed, the very rules by which it plays the game of existence changing as it is encompassed by this new region. Experiencing the change is likely to be instantaneous death, as the very rules which cause electrons and protons and neutrons will be fundamentally changed. The fundamental particles that make up the matter of your body will no longer behave the same, or even exist. It's tough to say what would happen in this new vacuum, the only certainty is that you'd be fried by the utterly absurd energies being released at the surface of this new region (as in, Big Bang fried) followed by your constituent matter no longer being supported by their field and just kind of... dissolving or something.

To ease your mind, if a field were to find a new minimum, starting at the centre of our galaxy, it would take 50,000 years to erase the galaxy, 2.5 million years to reach Andromeda, 10 million years to swallow the Local Group, 500 million years to remove the Virgo Supercluster, and of course around 13 billion years to annihilate the universe. Not that we would see it coming, but hey, if it's already started, we've probably got some time left to enjoy it.

Final side note: this is related to Inflation Theory in cosmology, except in that the field in question is a completely new field, with particles called inflatons which may or may not be observable, and in most forms the field has a *time dependant"" component, allowing the energy to be released in both a more global and controlled way.

Gravity is a pull, it can not push the universe apart. 
The universe is by definition everything there is.
So even if it is dark, the matter that is ""needed"" to accelerate the expansion of all the space in the universe is still contained within the universe itself. 
The dark matter would have to be somehow outside of the universe to pull the universe apart. 
I will acknowlege that perhaps gravity could pull part of the universe apart at a faster rate than other parts  but it defies any logic to me to assert that the entire universe could be pulled apart from within.

Could we do a version of the acdm where the cosmological constant is 100% of the expansion force and flip the effects of the force gravity to a counterforce? Ie.  say gravity is not pulling the universe apart but rather pushes against the CC. If that works, then you no longer need dark matter. The value of the CC would be instead determined by the equaision.  It would likely have the effect of requiring gravity to be increasing with the rate of expansion but the effect may be so small that we could not measure it.",no,view comment
158,,[deleted],08/03/18,3,,3,"Dark energy and it's percentage has ties back to the 1920's when enstien was kicking around the idea of a cosmological constant in his field equation(iirc) He couldn't quite get the maths to workout with a static universe so he threw out that part of the theory. 

Later when Hubble discovered the universe is expanding the calculations were tried again and have proven to be correct if the constant is expressed as a positive.

160,,Fbyrne,08/03/18,6,,6,"Has anyone considered the energy does not emanate from within the universe but from outside. For example, if you were in a boiling pot of water and all you could observe was the water and could not see past the pot. Examining all the observable properties of the water you couldnt account for the energy causing the heat. You would indeed conclude there is dark energy somewhere in the water. But you'd be wrong. It's coming from outside the water. Could it be a force from outside the universe is causing the ever quickening expansion? 

In fact, if something were in essence pulling apart the universe wouldn't that account for the energy in a black hole. Giving black holes giant suction in the same way when water gets pulled through a drain. Instead of water the universe is filled with gravity. ",no,view comment
161,,Drmadanthonywayne,08/03/18,1,,1,"Sure.  If it’s close enough to a star we might see a shadow, or if it’s large enough it might block starlight like a nebula.  But I’m wondering about just random asteroids in interstellar space and things like that.  They could even be planet sized but if there’s no star nearby, how would we detect them beyond their gravitational effects?  Or perhaps there are a bunch of failed stars.  Gas giants that didn’t quite have enough mass to become a star.  If there’s no star nearby, I wouldn’t think we could detect it.  Could there even be more gas giants that didn’t become stars than there are stars?",no,view comment
162,,Roxfall,08/03/18,1,,1,"Observable universe has a well-defined volume.

But that's not relevant, it's too big. People look at interactions between galaxies or between parts of a galaxy. For those purposes, a galaxy is a closed system. And stuff doesn't add up. The remainder that isn't explained is labeled ""dark"" something or other. And 72% is a lot. ",no,view comment

164,,klesto92,08/03/18,2,,2,"Ah you seem to have a little misconception about gravity here. While it is true that matter is attracted to other matter due to gravity it doesn’t have to be the same for space-time. You might have already heard of this but within the theoretical framework of General Relativity gravity is the manifestation of the curvature of space-time itself produced by matter (or energy). You can imagine it like a blanket where you put a big watermelon on top (you can do this yourself with some help) and you see how that watermelon deforms the blanket and pulls other less massive objects like marbles towards it. The thing is, the equations of General Relativity are incredibly complicated, Einstein himself though there was no analytical solution to them until Karl Schwarzschild found the first one (his solution is where the idea of Black Holes comes from). The equations themselves admit a wide variety of solutions (not necessarily physical or aplicable to nature) even to the point where time can be bent towards itself and the future and past are connected in a loop (basically timetravel). 

For this particular solution in cosmology even with ordinary matter the universe can expand and can even contract. You can do the study I explained for just ordinary matter and light and force it to adjust to the observations and it gives you a range of values for the amount of light and matter that are likely to be what cause this expansion (ordinary matter could produce this accelerating expansion as well!) the problem is that when you observe the amount of ordinary matter and light in the universe (or in what we observe of the universe) there simply is not enough to produce this effect and is in disagreement with the model. So we need to input some kind of fluid we don’t know and haven’t observed so that we have the observed amount of matter and light within the universe.

The problem with your proposed solution is that the contents of the universe are restricted by a little equation called “the Friedmann equation”. We work with fractional densities (or basically percentages) of the contents of the universe and the equation restricts them to combine to a 100%, everything contributes to how the universe evolves. As you can see that we have about 70% of dark energy and 25% or something like that of dark matter they are the biggest contributors to how the universe works. The need to introduce them is not because ordinary matter couldn’t produce an expanding universe (because it can) we introduce them because there isn’t enough ordinary matter observed to actually produce the accelerated expansion.",no,view comment

166,,mikelywhiplash,08/03/18,1,,1,"If something was affecting the observable universe from outside the observable universe, then essentially, that thing wouldn't properly be outside the observable universe at all: we're observing it, albeit indirectly.

It's not too far off though - once we rule out everything that we do know about, we say that it's something we don't know much about, with a name, ""dark energy."" But it's too simple to just describe it as a uniform pull from a distant region. You'd need an explanation for why the effect scales with distance, but not any particular direction, among other things. ",no,view comment
167,,mikelywhiplash,08/03/18,1,,1,"Sure, anything's possible. But it would take a lot of very specific tweaks to G to produce the effects we see, without a kind of generalized logic to explain it. Right now, our explanation is actually pretty simple: it seems like there's stuff out there, but we can't see it. ",no,view comment

169,,mikelywhiplash,08/03/18,2,,2,"Sure, it's always possible that our models are wrong.

But the dark matter explanation is much simpler than the alternative: we have a model that suggests that there is a lot of stuff around the galaxy, which we can't see - we just need an explanation for that invisibility and then we can get on with our lives.

The alternative is that the correct theory of gravity makes almost all the same predictions as our current theory, but in certain circumstances, acts exactly as though there were extra stuff in certain places. 

Maybe such a theory exists - there's been a lot of research in that direction. But none of it works yet. It remains an active area of research, but a hard-to-detect fundamental particle appears more fruitful.

Dark energy is considerably less well established, but so far, there's very little in the way of promising alternatives.

Matter would have a glow, matter would obscure light in this way, small black holes would bend light this way, matter density like this would result in galaxy formation like this....

175,,Jeremiah_Steele,27/04/18,2,,2,"Here is a really stupid question regarding dark matter; could the missing matter simply be ""normal"" matter we can't see? As in, its not reflecting enough light for us to detect? So in essence, the amount of matter we are calculating to be there is just way short of how much is actually there. So instead of saying our mass calculations are incorrect, we are making up a mysterious thing called dark matter to account for the missing mass??",no,view comment
