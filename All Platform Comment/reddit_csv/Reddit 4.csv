Edit: this comment is no longer relevant so I will offer a counterpoint to the sort of comments I describe. Before we know something, we must know what we don’t. Finding the exact bounds of what we don’t know helps us characterize the problem and poke at the boundary between unknown and understood.

97,,reelznfeelz,20/10/2022,-12,,-12,"Agreed. I often wonder if physics and cosmology is gong to simply run up against he limit of the human mind at some point.  And if that point might even be well in the past.  Or, if there will instead be a second d golden age of physics like 1900 to 1960 where things just moved incredibly fast and we gained reams of new ideas that were actually born out by experimentation.  Or if we need another Einstein or Newton to come along and make the leap.  

I hope I live to see it.  Because it might just be incredible.  Of course, it may never happen.  Our minds are really not that advanced in some ways.

137,,kie1,20/10/2022,22,,22,"I really hope that the pessimistic outlook on science isn't one opinion that has cemented in your heart, as that be quite a disheartening thing to hear. Scientific measurement and objective quantifying can come in many many different flavors, and out of all those flavors only one is to describe a object exactly how it is. 

The unknown can be understood in a roundabout way, you can poke and prod at the edges until you can clearly say that it has certain aspects or it isn't doesn't have certain aspects. Once we have a rought perimeter of the unknown, we can work on shrinking the it via more targeted experiments to nail down the exact working method of the unknown. Then we can work on quantifying it's aspects, then we can work out a theory of the unknown, and finally, we understand the unknown.

Take a invisible apple as an example. One day we bump into it on our kitchen counter, and we have no idea what it is. Since we can't see it, there's no way for us to examine what it is visually. So let's try touching it, then we can conclude that the exterior is smooth and waxy, some spots are soft while overall it's quite hard. It's sitting on the countertop so it's obviously affected by gravity, placing it on a scale gives us about 200 grams. With the weight and shape we can work out it's density. Let's try smelling it next, ah it smells like apples! But it also just happen to smell like apples so let's not jump to conclusions. Since it's soft in certain spots, let's try cutting it open. The mass we obtained from the cut is damp and crunchy, the texture is quite coarse and spongy. The liquid came out is runny but also sticky, a quick glucose test shows us it's full of it. Now let's have a taste, since sugar is edible, ah, it also tastes like an apple!

By now we know it kinda shapes like an apple, density comparable to an apple, smells like an apple, tastes like an apple, cuts like an apple and feels like an apple. With this we can tentatively conclude its a good chance it is an apple. But this isn't the end, we have only concluded what it could be, not is. So now we work on our hypothesis of it's an apple and run more tests. Chemical analysis, dye test, dna sequencing, taste profiling and all that. Once we are sure that it is very much like an apple, we can work out a theory to define and predict future instances of these invisible apples. 

And that is how science works, we measure what it could or could not be, then slowly shrink the definition of what it could and could not be until we are pretty sure what it is",no,view comment

The unknown can be understood in a roundabout way, you can poke and prod at the edges until you can clearly say that it has certain aspects or it isn't doesn't have certain aspects. Once we have a rought perimeter of the unknown, we can work on shrinking the it via more targeted experiments to nail down the exact working method of the unknown. Then we can work on quantifying it's aspects, then we can work out a theory of the unknown, and finally, we understand the unknown.

Take a invisible apple as an example. One day we bump into it on our kitchen counter, and we have no idea what it is. Since we can't see it, there's no way for us to examine what it is visually. So let's try touching it, then we can conclude that the exterior is smooth and waxy, some spots are soft while overall it's quite hard. It's sitting on the countertop so it's obviously affected by gravity, placing it on a scale gives us about 200 grams. With the weight and shape we can work out it's density. Let's try smelling it next, ah it smells like apples! But it also just happen to smell like apples so let's not jump to conclusions. Since it's soft in certain spots, let's try cutting it open. The mass we obtained from the cut is damp and crunchy, the texture is quite coarse and spongy. The liquid came out is runny but also sticky, a quick glucose test shows us it's full of it. Now let's have a taste, since sugar is edible, ah, it also tastes like an apple!

By now we know it kinda shapes like an apple, density comparable to an apple, smells like an apple, tastes like an apple, cuts like an apple and feels like an apple. With this we can tentatively conclude its a good chance it is an apple. But this isn't the end, we have only concluded what it could be, not is. So now we work on our hypothesis of it's an apple and run more tests. Chemical analysis, dye test, dna sequencing, taste profiling and all that. Once we are sure that it is very much like an apple, we can work out a theory to define and predict future instances of these invisible apples. 

And that is how science works, we measure what it could or could not be, then slowly shrink the definition of what it could and could not be until we are pretty sure what it is",no,view comment

At this point, all anonymous platforms are basically 4chan and every year it gets worse.  

Facebook is awful for sure though. I’d also call out Facebook’s demographics too.  Its used by older folk, which imo is less dangerous than younger platforms",no,view comment

My feeling is that qm applies at all scales but other forces do not, and that dark energy and dark matter are forces we cannot perceive as they do not interact on our  scale, but we can see the outputs of their effects.

That wouldn't make much sense. We literally don't know what they are...

Dark matter could be a particle, some sort of field, a flaw in our understanding of gravitation, a collection of phenomena which all add mass to galaxies, etc. Naming it is premature, but individual theories have names, e.g. WIMPs.

Dark energy is even less understood. It's even more likely to be a flaw in measurement or a fundamental misunderstanding of some cosmic physics. But again, theories that posit a specific mechanism do have names.

> Even the Higgs had a name/term before it was discovered

Sort of. It was called several things, but it was a special case. It wasn't a phenomena without a cause, it was a predicted measurement with a well understood cause if it was actually detected.",no,view comment

Now, maybe you're arguing that these observed and mathematically deduced phenomena are, in fact, the result of external influences on our universe. However, there is currently no evidence to support this, and you would need to conceive of a way to test such a theory in observable fashion.

I'll continue to wait for people with basic reading comprehension. No where did I say the big bang was the beginning of everything. Rather, I said there was no *evidence* to support the idea that dark energy/matter existed prior to the big bang.

You are, in essence, arguing that our universe, prior to the big bang, existed on some unobservable aetheric sea *outside* the universe. You provide no evidence to support this claim, and instead take to misrepresenting what I've written.

Yes, dark matter has unresolved issues (what area in science doesn't?), but those are known in spite of MOND supporters who, frankly, are still stuck in the 70s and laser focused on galactic scales.",no,view comment

933,,Xaxxon,22/10/2022,1,,1,"I just don’t like that it’s retconned into solving a problem when we don’t even know if it’s real.    

We just keep changing the definition to solve the problem.    

It’s kind of like string theory.   

Neither are making any predictions.   They are just hand waves solutions adjusted to “solve” things we don’t understand.",no,view comment
