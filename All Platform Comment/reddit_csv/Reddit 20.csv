27,,ColonialDagger,06/08/15,46,,46,"""The most astounding fact is the knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on Earth the atoms that make up the human body are traceable to the crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy elements in their core under extreme temperatures and pressures. These stars, the high mass ones among them went unstable in their later years they collapsed and then exploded scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy guts made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself. These ingredients become part of gas cloud that condense, collapse, form the next generation of solar systems stars with orbiting planets, and those planets now have the ingredients for life itself. So that when I look up at the night sky and I know that yes, we are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the Universe is in us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up – many people feel small because they’re small and the Universe is big – but I feel big, because my atoms came from those stars. There’s a level of connectivity. That’s really what you want in life, you want to feel connected, you want to feel relevant you want to feel like a participant in the goings on of activities and events around you That’s precisely what we are, just by being alive…""

28,,AwkwardTurtle,06/08/15,12,,12,"There's a lot more evidence for dark matter than just galaxy rotation curves. Saying that dark matter is just ""fudging the numbers"" does a huge disservice to scientists. 

Do you really think the people who have decided to spend their whole life trying to figure out how things work, decided to just throw some random factor in there and call it a day?

My favorite piece of evidence is the [Bullet Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster). I'll repost a comment I made a while ago on the topic:

>More detailed information (and better quality copies of the image) can be found [here](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2006/1e0657/).

>This image is a composite image of visible light (from Hubble), X-rays (pink, from Chandra), and gravitational lensing (blue, also from hubble).

>This is the bullet cluster, formed from two large galactic clusters that collided.  When two clusters collide, the galaxies themselves tend to pass right through each other, as they're located pretty far apart.  What *doesn't* pass through that easily, is all the gas in the clusters.  This gas, which turns out to make up the lion's share of the mass in a cluster, smashes into the gas from the other cluster during the collision.  This 'hot gas' shines in the X-Ray, which is what is mapped in pink by Chandra in the image.  This pink map shows where most of the Baryonic (or not Dark) matter resides in these clusters.

>The blue mapping, is done by observing the distortions caused by gravitational lensing of the galaxies *behind* the cluster.  This shows where most of the mass is... *all* the mass.  And since most of any mass is Dark matter, and we already have a map of where the normal matter is, this is a map of where the Dark matter is residing.  ([Here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bullet_cluster_lensing.jpg) a contour plot of the graviational lensing found in the Bullet Cluster, if you wanted a bit more detail the the blue map gives you.)

>And in what is one of the coolest Astronomy results pretty much ever, we can very easily see that the bulk of the mass in this cluster is *not* where the bulk of the normal matter is.  WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PICTURE OF NORMAL AND DARK MATTER SEPERATING.  This happens becuase Dark matter (apparently) interacts only graviationally, so the two lumps of Dark matter simply passed through each other without slowing when the collision happened (similar to how the two groups of galaxies pass through each other), while the hot gas collided and stayed in the center.

There are a few alternative theories to explain it, such as some versions of MOND, but MOND has way more issues and doesn't tend to match up with a lot of other observations so I'm not willing to put a ton of stock into it.

32,,Lespaul42,06/08/15,2,,2,"Your edit there is ... kinda zany... but I guess all I am saying that it is sorta funny how science and scientific theories work in a way that would seem crazy for just an average guy to work
If I was to say that ""There are 10x more blue cars then every other car out there!"" and day one I count all the cars and there are 10x more blue cars. Then the next day there aren't and the next day there aren't as well and instead of changing my theory I just assume it is correct and then I make a new theory ""Up the street farther then I can test there is some sort of phenomenon that paints most blue cars other colours at such and such a rate"" And now all my numbers match up and I call this the Dark Painter!

I understand that this comparison doesn't hold water because scientific theories predict things much better most of the time then my car thoery and have worked much longer... It is just funny

I guess if there was anything to criticize it might be this video that while trying to explain a complicated topic in layman terms which may confuse people into thinking dark matter is as definite a thing as matter is instead of a current theory to explain discrepancies between expected and actual results of experiments ",no,view comment

89,,artifex28,06/08/15,29,,29,"Could both the dark matter and energy actually be ""just an topological illusion"" caused by a higher dimension interacting with ours? What I mean by that is probably the easiest explained through a 3D object being sectioned and depicted as a 2D.

Check the following: http://offbeat.topix.com/story/11415

Now imagine that our whole 3D universe would be a similar ""section"" of a 4D object. That way there is no force *within* our universe that could explain the eg. the accelerating growth of the universe. Instead the 3D space itself is being ""manipulated"" outside due to a 4D object showing a similar section than we can see in 2D of the 3D object.

Another interesting question is ""where do the virtual particles come from""? There has to be some sort of energy that generates them. If the annihilation releases the energy to us, it seems to be that the only ""realistic"" scenario is that the source of the energy is a higher dimension, ""bleeding"" energy to us. Perhaps that's due to the movement of the 4D object through the 3D? As long as there is change, whether it's growth or collapsing, the space itself would act as the median for the particles to appear from.

But perhaps these two things are entwined... who knows. Maybe future tells. Interesting times. :)

**Edit:** The creation of space due to 4D object intersecting with 3D, could in these far fetched theories also explain Big Bang. At first OUR universe doesn't exist. There's nothing. Yet, 3rd dimension exists at same time in parallel universes, completely separated 3D spaces. The strawberry intersections visualize this pretty well. When the 4D object passes through ""the concept of 3rd dimension"", the areas where the intersection happens are seeing creation of actual 3D space. So when a 4D object passes through the 3rd dimension, we would perceive it as a 3D object appearing out of nowhere, expanding, then contracting into nothing. That would mean that were all living inside a higher dimensional system, which sounds pretty comfy. :)",no,view comment

Back then people would be like (observing behavior of charged pieces of matter) ""ok, so these particles are just behaving strangely"" and they could either be like ""there must be something wrong with our existing laws- the conservation of energy is clearly wrong and most likely every other law in our mechanics"" or ""there's something else, the undiscovered field, energy, the undiscovered properties of matter"" and most of the time the second kind of thinking got us somewhere (for instance, through this way of thinking we discovered electromagnetic field and the quantum mechanics model that works somehow (thanks to which you have now your computer or cellphone in front of you) , whereas the first one never got us anywhere..

 I don't think there's such thing as wrong in science- if one formula works for specific circumsances, it works, it won't be changed, but the formula can get more advanced (however, it will be transformed to this old same formula for those cases) . For example, if you observe a specific case of classical dynamics, you can get pretty complicated equations (with all the double/triple integrals, matrices etc. etc.)  out of nothing more than the simple Newton's laws. And what I think is that our knowledge now knows these equations for specific cases, but doesn't yet know the ""Newton's laws"" , yet that doesn't make those old equations wrong, it's rather a  fulfillment of our old formulas.

When matter decays, it becomes dark matter, and the space that the physical matter once occupied is now virtually empty so space collapses in on it. Bigger objects with more matter have more decaying matter at once so more space collapses in on it. When the space collapses, all matter around it converge on that location, making gravity.

Then I went into thinking about how the universe collapses as two sides of a wave. The expansion being the rising side. Well, a full cycled sine wave is 360 degrees and the rise and fall / expansion and collapse could only represent 180 degrees of our universe. The last 180 degrees could be like some sort of anti universe.

180,,DiogenesHoSinopeus,06/08/15,13,,13,"Mark my words that some day people will figure out that the space isn't expanding, it's just that time keeps speeding up.  
  
We know that photon's do not evolve through time as they are massless particles. From the perspective of a photon distances do not exist either, their origin and destination practically occupy the same space. This is integral to why they appear to be red-shifted when looking into the past (*things that are far away*).  
  
Now you look at the night sky and see distant galaxies and quasars red-shifted as if they are moving further away. You conclude that the space is expanding in between.  
  
I'm proposing that the space isn't really expanding and the galaxies are not really moving, but that time keeps speeding up. The reason why distant galaxies seem to red-shift the further they are away is that **the light is very old** from a time when clocks ticked slower compared to today. The region of space you are in is always in the center of the observable universe and anything further away from that center is practically always **in the past**.  
  
What happens if time keeps speeding up and you measure blue light from a period of time where time ticked slower? **It appears to be red shifted**. The light wasn't really red shifted at the time, it just appears to be now when measured in a time where clocks tick a little faster.  
  
Now...since the acceleration of time is constant it can continue indefinitely since the only thing that is measurably different from your perspective is the differential compared to the past. It can keep accelerting infinitely without ever affecting your own personal experience of the passage of time. Everything you experience will always appear to tick at the same rate even though **compared to your past**, it has sped up. Things you see from the past will always appear to be red-shifted....as they seem to be.

207,,DiogenesHoSinopeus,07/08/15,3,,3,"Dark energy doesn't really fit into anything currently known about the laws of physics either, only that the red-shift can be explained by the presence of this energy. It's a necessary evil at this moment and it really only creates more questions than it answers. **As far as I am aware** the only real evidence for the existence of Dark Energy and the apparent red-shift/expansion at all are the ""standard candles"" that rely on the assumptions that we know enough about supernovae and variable stars to gauge their brightness accurately. Their usefulness/accuracy for measuring distances is still controversial.  
  
Dark matter is not related to dark energy, so my theory is not a threat to the existence of dark matter and it shouldn't interfere with it.  
  
As for the Big Bang: nothing can currently explain it. My theory would change things a little in the time right after the Big Bang in a way that instead of space expanding faster than the speed of light (*during the great inflation*), time ran backwards at an unfathomable rate. We know that our universe **is** currently cooling down and that entropy is increasing. According to my theory, during this rapid time-reversal-period the universe would have become unimaginably hot and entropy would have ran backwards as far as it can all the way to perfect uniformity. We know that the conditions right after the Big Bang **were** exactly these (*hot, uniform and 0 in entropy*), it fits perfectly with my theory. The whole universe resets as the clock runs backwards. This also removes the question ""*why did entropy start at 0?*"". Since we already know that entropy increases over time, the only possible conclusion of that fact is that, if time reversed it would inevitably become 0 during backwards-time-travel if it increases during forward-time-travel.  
  
There is a way to test my theory and if it is true however. It would be to measure if signals from a probe sent into space are red-shifted the further they are from us even if they are not moving away. Though the problem here is that the red-shift would be so immeasurably small that there is no practical way of ever measuring it. If we would use Voyager-1's signal for the experiment, it's frequency would have shifted 1/6.5 billionth from the emitted frequency. Differences that small are practically impossible to measure outside of very strict and perfectly controlled laboratory settings with lasers on a table.  
  
As to ""*why*"" would time behave like this. I have no explanation for that. I don't know if time will reverse again on its own or if it will keep accelerating indefinitely. The only way to create the conditions of a Big Bang would be to reverse time entirely and the only phenomenons currently known that could possibly do that are super massive black holes. Inside each could be another another Big Bang happening...and that's not even a new idea in the scientific community.

225,,artifex28,07/08/15,2,,2,"Interesting idea! Time dilation is certainly easier to explain to people if you first get them to understand that photons are ""subjectively out of time"", being everywhere at all time (if you'd ask that photon, that is).

In the core of the hypothesis you've time, which as you point out, is subjective. From the viewpoint of a photon time doesn't exist. At same time [we do know that even light speed isn't constant even in vacuum after all.](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/speed-light-not-so-constant-after-all)

That has few implications.

* The photons aren't all the same
* As light means the photons, the light speed is the local maximum speed, but in different areas of space, that varies. Due to what? What causes the photons to slow down?
* As the photons slow down relatively to the location/properties of the vacuum, do they speed up again?

What kind of impact does this have to the subjective time of a photon? If so, are the photons actually excluded from the effects of the time after all? During the acceleration, isn't the ""time slope"" actually curved? What accelerates the time? What causes the time to be a linear slope? And as there's something that can cause change in the light speed, isn't it logical to presume that there's external dimensions around us that have an impact to ours?

An ""external observer"" certainly can see a photon travel from point A to B, which means that a location/time coordinate could be assigned to every single photon in the existence.

To my main point.

I claim that time is nothing but an emergent property of ANY non-static system. If there's any change in the system, time exists. An external observer (eg. a higher dimensional being, that can manipulate the lower dimensions as they wish), could always use ""time"" as a search term if you had index built from every single event that occurs in the system. If everything was static however, there wouldn't be time, since no matter how much the ""external observer"" tried, he never could find any events in the system. Nothing changes. The system ""just is"".

We know that photons are carriers and cannot be destroyed, only absorbed. This means that a system CANNOT be dynamic, unless photons or similar carriers exist, causing entropy and thus change. So could the photons be in the core of the mystery here? Or even more likely, a higher dimensional structure having an impact to our ""static photons"", forcing the change of light speed in vacuum. Who knows.

Let's presume it is. I've always enjoyed this video depicting non-spatial dimensions, which essentially is nothing but a logical explanation how to form groups. It's nothing but a thought process, so wouldn't be too harsh on it, which the hard scientists tend to do quite often when discussing on that video. *No man! 4th dimension is an actual spatial space*. Well it is, if you want to depict 4th dimension as a 4th spatial dimension. But dimension itself can be anything as long as there's a coordinate with a new axis. You can stack the previous data on X-axis and depict everything on a 2D yet.

But if you want a quick answer, a gross oversimplification is the only way to explain it. that and the ""This is just one of the ways our reality works"" answer.

270,,null_work,07/08/15,2,,2,"> There's pretty hard evidence for dark matter, seeing gravitational lensing where there isn't enough normal matter to cause enough gravity. 

Except that's begging the question. That's not hard evidence for dark matter's existence in lieu of a misunderstanding of gravity. A misunderstanding of gravity could account for gravitational effects larger than what the mass in that area should be causing.

All that gravitational lensing is evidence of is that we are currently lacking in knowledge about *something*.",no,view comment
271,,null_work,07/08/15,1,,1,"> It doesn't provide a model of the universe that would explain why time is speeding up. It fails to explain dark matter, and how galaxies are held together. It completely dismisses the existence of dark energy. And, assuming you subscribe to the big bang theory, it doesn't explain how all matter and energy started at a single point and everywhere in the universe simultaneously. 

Most of those things aren't explained anyways, or are equivalent objects.

I mean, does our current understanding provide a model of the universe that would explain why the expansion is increasing? No. We just throw in a constant and say ""dark energy!""

Dark matter and gravity seem to be independent of this person's concept.

It should dismiss the existence of dark energy considering it's an alternate explanation for expansion and that's dark energy's purpose.

And it does explain the final point in that matter and energy starting at a single point isn't something we know for fact. It's something we determine from based on our idea that space is expanding. If space isn't expanding, then it didn't start at a single point.",no,view comment

It's easy to speculate on things like this, but it's another thing to express it formally and to understand the actual implications of what you're saying. It's very likely that your proposed explanation is not consistent or does not allow a variety of phenomena to exist. Without it being formalized, it's just an imaginative fancy.",no,view comment

284,,reverendpariah,07/08/15,1,,1,"Yea, sure, it's a lack of understanding somewhere, but general relativity works very well in understanding gravity until we get to singularities. It's pretty hard to get rid of gr and it's much more plausible that there's some sort of matter that doesn't interact with electromagnetism. 

Plus, there are things like the bullet cluster, two galaxy clusters that collided and we see the bulk of the gravitational lensing outside where the mass of the galaxies are. This is spot on to what would happen if two clumps of matter and dark matter collided. The matter would slow down and stay closer because of electromagnetism, but the dark matter would pass right through and be farther out. Pretty cool stuff. ",no,view comment
