It boils down to there being a [metric fuckton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Observational_evidence) of evidence for dark matter being non-EM-interacting matter, and nature would have to conspire against us in a very specific way for the current theories to hold so well experimentally and be wrong at the same time.",no,view comment
3,,Dawn_of_afternoon,04/08/21,43,,43,"Apologies for short answer; I am about to go to bed and I am using a phone. It boils down to a lot of independent observational evidence pointing towards dark matter (see relevant section here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter?wprov=sfla1.) Even alternative theories of how gravity works need some sort of dark matter (e.g. MOND and the Bullet Cluster). 


Could it be that alternative GR models are the actual answer? For sure, but they are so much more complicated than a dark matter model. Moreover, they would have to make to predictions similar to those made by using dark matter (as it is a very good model), whilst making testable predictions allowing us to distinguish between dark matter or these alternative theories. These differences in predictions may be tiny and beyond what we can measure currently.",no,view comment

5,,ExpectedBehaviour,04/08/21,24,,24,"The models could be wrong, but then you have to explain why they seem to be right and accurate for everything else *while still being wrong about dark matter*. Cosmologists don't believe in dark matter because it's *cool and fun*, they believe it in it because theories that have withstood a huge amount of testing and observation and have strong predictive power show that dark matter is also a thing. In fact having a big unexplained predicted thing that has so far proven to be observationally and empirically problematic sitting in the middle of cosmology makes a lot of scientists uncomfortable; they'd rather it wasn't there, or at least if it were be easier to understand, but that's just not how science works. You go where the data takes you, not where you'd like it to go.

EDITED TO ADD: Your argument regarding Occam's Razor is also flawed, but this is a common misunderstanding of Occam's Razor. Occam's Razor holds that on balance the simpler theory is preferable *only* *if the theories being considered are equally likely*.

I wouldn’t look at it this way. There were no predictions that exclude dark matter, so there’s nothing to “fix” by dark matter. Nothing in Standard model says that it’s complete and I don’t think that early universe formation theories preclude formation of macroscopic massive “dark” objects.

There are known particles like this, for example the neutrino. Dark matter particles would behave much like neutrinos in that they wouldn't interact with light and can pass right through solid objects like planets and stars. This makes dark matter, like neutrinos, very difficult to directly detect. But dark matter has mass (neutrinos have almost none), so its gravity affects the rest of the galaxy in ways we can detect.

There's another possibility, that dark matter is mostly made up of celestial objects that we can't see with our current instruments. Black holes are one candidate for this type of dark matter. However, recent microlensing searches for black holes and other massive dark objects haven't found them in the numbers necessary to account for dark matter, so the particle explanation is more likely.",no,view comment

20,,First_Approximation,05/08/21,16,,16,"1. General relativity works extremely well in other areas we've tested it. Modifying it (or Newtonian gravity which GR reduces to in the weak field limit) is difficult without making things inconsistent or contradict other data or seem completely ad hoc.
2. We already know of matter that interacts very weakly  with ordinary matter: neutrinos, so there could be other particles like that as well. 

In fact, the only neutrinos we've seen are left handed and are thought to be too light to be dark matter. However, every other fermion we've seen comes it right and left variety. There's also good reason to suspect that a right handed neutrinos would be massive. They would only interact with matter via gravity,  so all the right properties for DM.

It's not *impossible* that we're wrong about gravity, but modified gravity hypotheses generally fail to predict all the various effects we see from dark matter, often while adding ad hoc spandrels to fit as much as they can. The presence of something with mass that doesn't interact electromagnetically does a great job of explaining all the observations, including things like anisotropic distributions of dark matter with no clear association to regular matter which stuff like [MOND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics) really struggles with.

There's a decent chance we're wrong about gravity in a very strict sense, in the same way that Newton was wrong about gravity in a very strict sense. However, in a more practical sense, Newton was right about gravity *in the appropriate limits*. We still use Newtonian dynamics to send probes to Mars and stuff just fine. General relativity had to not only explain observations (shockingly, made *after* GR was formulated) that disagreed with Newtonian dynamics but *also* it had to agree with Newton on just about everything else. Newtonian dynamics had a tremendous amount of evidence for being right by the early 20th century, so any new theoretical framework would by necessity have to agree with ND.

28,,Astrokiwi,05/08/21,5,,5,"Put it this way: Isn't it more probable that there's a currently undiscovered type of particle with only slightly different properties to particles we have already observed, rather than postulating some arbitrary change to our laws of physics to magically explain away the discrepancy?

We know neutrinos exist, we produce them in nuclear reactors and detect solar neutrinos quite routinely. A neutrino is a particle that only interacts via the weak nuclear force and gravity. It has most of the properties you expect from a hypothetical dark matter particle. But we rule it out as the main source of dark matter based on how we know neutrinos are produced, how massive they are, and how fast they go. Basically, there's not quite enough of them, and they are individually too light and move too quickly, so they shouldn't form the galaxy sized halos we observe.

What you should take from this is that we actually understand something about particle physics. We know how subatomic particles move and interact with each other. Dark matter isn't an arbitrary fudge factor - we have well-established ways to constrain how dark matter should behave. We aren't changing the laws of physics, which means we are constrained by the classic laws of physics and can't just make stuff up. This means we can do models to test whether the observed gravity could fit with a distribution of dark matter, and what that dark matter particle would have to look like. Additionally, from the particle physics side we're pretty sure we haven't discovered every single type of particle that exists, and there's plenty of room to find more.

But if we're changing the fundamental laws of physics, all bets are off. There's no real constraints here, because you are changing the constraints. So of course you can match the observations, but the problem is that's no real test that your physics are correct. You are basically playing with epicycles here - arbitrarily modifying your model to fit the observations.

So yeah, it's possible gravity may act differently on large scales, but we really need to rule out the simpler and more obvious answer of ""there's more stuff that's slightly different"" before we fundamentally change the laws of physics to fit a couple of oddities. And even then, we really need a lot more evidence before we know which direction to change the laws of physics, rather than basically just arbitrarily inventing stuff that sounds nice.",no,view comment

I should mention that you are making a classic mistake about Occam's Razor.  Occam's Razor doesn't say the simplest solution is more likely, it says the model with the fewest parameters is more likely (depending on the value of the likelihood that is).  The difference is the former would rely on an individual's personal knowledge of the field while the latter is a quantifiable metric.  Dark matter has essentially 1 parameter: the dark matter density.  If you are going to say ""there is an issue with our models"" then you need to provide a better one.

If you throw some dark matter through a magnetic field or next to an electron, it won’t change its behavior at all (other than the negligible change in gravity).

Dark matter clearly interacts with gravity; that’s how we know it’s there. As for the other two forces, some posited forms of dark will interact with the weak force (notably WIMPs), but, as far as I know, it isn’t supposed to interact with the strong force.

It can’t be black holes because we see lots of evidence that it’s basically everywhere. Essentially all galaxies are surrounded by a dark matter halo. If that was a black hole, we couldn’t see any other galaxies because light couldn’t escape from their black hole halo. I supposed you could ask if it could be black holes on an absurdly small scale - particle or even Planck scale - but it seems to me that if that were the case, essentially everything would almost instantly be sucked into one, and you’d have a lot of Hawking radiation since black holes that tiny would evaporate extremely quickly.",no,view comment

Maybe this is because it has no way of actually radiating that energy away other than gravitational waves, but i don't know.

55,,eliminating_coasts,26/08/21,1,,1,"To add to what has already been said, general relativity can be stated in an enormously simple way:

The curvature of space is dependent in a big way on the distribution of energy and momentum.

Is it directly proportional? No, because that would mean that curvature is conserved whenever matter and energy are conserved, which would give us lots of saddle shapes instead of bowls.

But if we do one tweak to our distribution of energy and momentum in our equation, (called trace reversing it) then we can cancel out the effect of conservation of energy and momentum, and get curvature almost directly proportional, except that it doesn't care whether energy is conserved or not.

Then we can take certain cases that we know from newtonian physics to set our constants, and we have general relativity!

(According to Mark Carrol, from whom I got this explanation) curvature is about as close to proportional to the density of energy and momentum as it could be.

So when people go looking for adjustments to the theory, the most natural place to look is new forms of matter and energy that behave differently, because in almost all cases we can see some gravitational disturbence, flip it through the equation, guess there's a certain mass density, and see it with another telescope.
