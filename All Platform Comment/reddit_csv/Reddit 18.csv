I could be wrong, but I think the author's logic is: If invisible heavy objects (like black holes) make up a significant chunk of dark matter, they better account for it all, or they don't account for anything? ",no,view comment

We know this because stars in other galaxies (and the galaxys themselves) don't move like they should - but they do move like they would if there was a shitload more mass out there.

Now, if this mass was in black holes made of dark matter, we should be able to see gravitational lensing (stars behind the black hole would look different due to intense gravity warping spacetime) of stars without seeing a normal black hole, but we dont.

We don't know where it is, but by studying the movement and gravitational effects of our galaxy and beyond we know that it's there somewhere, influencing what we can see. We just haven't been able to point to how or where all this extra matter is.

Basically scientists looked at hundreds of recorded supernovas and other significant and easy to observe events and found no evidence of a black hole between them and us (a black hole create a sort of optical illusion as light could travel around it or bend to create a magnification effect), meaning the most obvious answer of all the extra matter just packed into black holes we couldn't observe being unlikely.

There is a small chance that that some if not most of this matter is in black holes at the bleeding edge of our expanding universe, though that seems unlikely given they would have been formed and expelled from the big bang faster than the less dense galaxies. Though, if this were the case, it would explain why galaxies seem to be accelerating towards the expanding edge.",no,view comment

14,,shadowninja2_0,02/10/18,10,,10,"I'm not an expert on any of this but I'll try to sum up what the article says:

First, it says that dark matter comprises about 85% of the universe, but nobody actually knows what it is. A suggestion was made that perhaps the dark consisted of a bunch of unseen, primordial black holes. Primordial meaning they came into existence basically at the beginning of the universe. 

However, this new research says that's not the case and thus we still don't actually know what dark matter is. They say that all these unseen black holes should be causing bending of light by their gravity, but statistical analysis of a bunch of supernovas whose light *would* be bent if this was the case show no such gravitational bending.

That's the best my non-scientist self can do.

If a scientist does show up, a question I have would be, how do we know that 85% of the universe is dark matter if we don't even know what it is? (not disputing the assertion, I'd just like to know the reasoning behind it, since I'm sure there is some)",no,view comment

17,,iamthe42,02/10/18,245,,245,"So there are two major theories about what dark matter is made up of, WIMPs and MACHOs. WIMPs are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles which means that they are particles of high mass that don't interact electromagnetically. MACHOs are Massive compact Halo Object which would be objects like brown dwarves or stellar mass black holes. Both of these theories give an explanation about why we can observe the effects of dark matter but cannot directly observe it. We can't observe WIMPs because they do not emit any wavelength of light and MACHOs because they emit almost no light. 

What this article is saying that that MACHOs cannot be more than 40% of the Dark Matter in the universe. How this was concluded was that Black Holes would be massive enough to bend the light from super nova which would increase the brightness of the light reaching us. I am not sure about their analysis of the brightness and distance of the super nova used so I can't say anything in that regard but I hope this helps explain the article a little bit.

Edit: some other theories about Dark Matter that I didn't mention is axions and MOND (modified Newtonian dynamics) I don't know to much about these but u/EvilMortyMaster explained MOND in the comments and this is the Wikipedia for axions: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion",no,view comment
18,,elizaofhousestark,02/10/18,1875,,1875,"Well, that’s an oversimplification.

Dark matter is virtually undetectable. We have not invented the technology to detect its particles, if it has any at all. But the math strongly supports its existence. For our current observations and measurements of the universe to make sense, the prediction of dark matter needs to be true. It has also been indirectly [proven](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/10/01/the-most-important-x-ray-image-ever-taken-proved-the-existence-of-dark-matter/#439acf5f69f7) to exist. 

Meanwhile, there is plenty of evidence, despite being indirect observations, on the existence of black holes. For example, a supermassive blackhole existing at the heart of our galaxy (and every other galaxy in conclusion) is the only working explanation on how fast the stars near the center are moving. Nothing else can have the energy and gravitational pull to fling massive stars around like that. [Here’s](https://www.google.com.ph/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/science-and-health/2018/1/8/16822272/black-hole-looks-like-what)
 a cool article on that.

**What exactly is Dark Matter?**

The gravitational effects of blackholes and stars and galaxies on each other aren’t strong enough to hold them in place. At the rate that the universe is expanding, mathematical calculations predict that they should be tearing apart because of dark energy. Dark Matter is therefore like a glue that holds galaxies in place.

Meanwhile, Dark Energy, also virtually undetectable, is the force that is tearing apart galaxies. It is why the rate of expansion of our universe has accelerated in relatively recent history. There is a big probability that our universe will end in a Big Rip or a Big Freeze where galaxies will be cold and lonely outposts in the vast expanse of space and our night sky will no longer be dotted with stars. Even atoms will be ripped apart eventually. 

The composition of our universe is predicted to be as follows:

- Heavy elements 0.03%
- Neutrinos 0.3%
- Stars 0.5%
- Hydrogen and Helium 4%
- Dark Matter 25%
- Dark Energy 70 %

In the last few decades, the field of extragalactic astronomy has grown as we are able to view galaxies at further and further distances away, and on more astronomical scales.

When looking at the behavior of these galaxies and galaxy clusters, astronomers noticed some strange behaviors that couldn’t be explained at first. Essentially what we’ve seen is that there is an abundance of “matter” in the universe which gravitationally binds galaxies and galaxy clusters together. We have modern day observations that actually show that the distributions of galaxy clusters makes a sort of [web](https://youtu.be/74IsySs3RGU?t=30s) throughout the universe. People began calculating at we’ve come to a pretty standard consensus that roughly 5/6 of the matter content in the universe is “dark matter”.

The name dark matter (or dark anything is astronomy) is called so because it can’t be observed through light; it emits to electromagnetic radiation, like normal matter (and antimatter) do. Because of this we also believe the dark matter to be “cold” because things with temperatures emit E-M radiation.

As lightly mentioned in the article, the theories for these dark matter particles are extensive and span many orders of magnitude. Many experiments have been imagined and searched for these particles, and nothing has been verified yet.

&#x200B;

So there are currently experiments out there running which are looking for a similar shock wave to what you're talking about, which is the gravitational waves from the inflationary period.  I also think it's really interesting that you use the term ""negative pressure"" to describe dark matter with respect to expansion. The solution to the Einstein field equations do actually yield an extra **positive** pressure term which is what we call the cosmological constant ? (as in the ?CDM model) which is the extra dark energy that drives the expansion of the universe. 

&#x200B;

However, a few things. Dark matter doesn't stop the expansion of the universe. Space still continues to expand, it's just that the objects moving through this spacetime are attracted to dark matter. This appears to be a gravitational effect, so stars/dust/gas/galaxies are draw towards dark matter in the same way they are to regular matter (but exclusively gravitationally). The other thing is that this ""shockwave"" you talk about, at least the way you describe, is moving from space into something else. Space doesn't expand into something (as far as we have observed). For a shockwave to exist there has to be something for this wave to propogate through. Expansion doesn't just happen at the edge of the universe either! All of space is expanding with respect to itself. For everywhere in space, as time goes on, there is more space per unit space (imagine piece of stretchy graph paper being pulled in all directions equally)!",no,view comment

I always thought/assumed the ""black holes are the (maybe) cause of dark matter"" argument was that there was a possible incomplete understanding as to how black holes effect the space around themselves? I.E. we treat their immediate body mass and interactions with nearby matter as if they obey GR like all other matter. But maybe black holes produce gravity differently and have a stronger gravitational influence further out than say a star or a planet.

I'm no astro-physicist and maybe this has already been ruled out, but because (based on my personal understanding) our physics break down once you enter a black hole, could the unknowns around what goes on inside a blackhole not be something to do with the 'invisible gravity' caused by 'dark matter'?

Arguably the best piece of evidence (although *indirect*) we have of the existence of dark matter occurred during the collision of two galaxy clusters.  The two clouds of interstellar gas medium riding along with the clusters slowed down and remained relatively centralized while the galaxies themselves passed through in both directions.  Observations of the visible matter there would tell you most of the mass should be in the cloud, but in fact in turns out most of the mass is still riding along with the galaxies despite the galaxies themselves not containing the sufficient visible matter.

That depends on what it is. If it would have been black holes this study would have found it (or one of the many previous ones setting more specialized limits). If it is WIMPs with suitable cross section one of the xenon experiments might find it in the next years. If it is axions with suitable cross section one of the axion experiments might find it in the next years. And so on. Sure, there are possible types of dark matter we cannot detect yet, but there are also many where it is possible.

That statement is about galaxies only.

The expansion of the universe has nothing to do with galaxies. Galaxies don't even participate in the expansion.

No it doesn't tear galaxies apart, it is too weak for that. It is only relevant between galaxy clusters.

There is no indication that dark energy would get stronger, something required for a Big Rip. A constant energy density is an easier scenario and wouldn't lead to a Big Rip.

91,,Xuvial,03/10/18,22,,22,"Bit more on the ""movement"" part. Our current laws of gravity predict that when objects orbit something, they closer they are, the faster they move. We can see this in our solar system - planets closer to the sun (Mercury, Venus, etc) are moving much faster  than planets further away (Saturn, Neptune, etc). Newton and Einstein's laws can be used to calculate orbital speeds accurately.

So the exact same principle should apply on the scale of galaxies - stars close to the galactic center should move really fast, and stars on the outer edges should move extremely slowly. But this is NOT what we see. For some inexplicable reason, we're seeing all the stars on the middle/outer edges of galaxies are racing around at speeds that shouldn't be possible. In fact stars are orbiting so fast that everything in the galaxy should be flying away (leaving just the core stars). 

This means that ""something"" must be keeping galaxies gravitational bound together. That ""something"" must be completely invisible, and contain approximately 5x more mass than everything that we *can* see. It's also something that only seems to become noticeable at exceptionally large scales (galaxies), and becomes irrelevant at smaller scales (e.g. planets/moons). So far we have no idea what that ""something"" is. Dark Matter is the placeholder name.

In the latest research paper, Back Holes have been ruled out as the source of all that extra gravity. It's something else.

Also the movement of stars isn't our only clue. There is also light. [When light travels around very massive objects, it becomes curved/bent](http://www.roe.ac.uk/~heymans/website_images/Gravitational-lensing-galaxyApril12_2010-1024x768.jpg) on it's way towards us. We can observe this bending effect and calculate exactly how much distant objects *should* be bending light. Turns out that galaxies are bending the light WAY more than they should be. The ""lensing"" effect is far too severe to just be caused by the visible mass of the galaxy. Only something with significantly more mass can cause the light to bend so much - but what is it?

When it comes to the current models about the Heat Death of the Universe, we're actually talking about something like 10^100 years (that's 10 with 99 extra zeros in front of it). That's around when most black holes will have evaporated, and all that's left are photons and leptons (i.e. electons, muons, tau particles, and their neutrinos) that will almost never interact with each other. At this point, there's really no useful energy left in the Universe (i.e. ""no more entropy"" aka ""heat death"").

For perspective, the universe is on the order of tens of billions, or 10^10 , years old today (specifically, about 13.8 billion years as far as we can tell). Now note that this doesn't mean that we're 10% of the way through the life of the Universe. 

The way exponents work, it actually means we're 10^-88 % , or 0.00...1 with 88 0's percent, of the way through the Universe.

It’s not about where the stars got the movement speed, it’s about gravity stuff. 

The earth has to rotate around the sun at a specific speed in order to go around it in a circle. If it were going faster, it might fly off far away from the sun. If it were going slower, it’s orbit might drop down much nearer to the sun.

The speed the earth must travel at is directly correlated with 1) the mass of the sun and 2) the distance from the sun. If we know both these things, we could figure out exactly what speed the earth needs to be going so it keeps going around the sun in the circle.

But wait! The earth is actually traveling much faster than the math says it should! It should be flying into space! Why might this be? The answer is that we don’t really know, but there must be something out there other than the sun causing gravity to be *much* higher than we think, so we attribute this unknown mass to “dark matter.”

186,,I_talk,03/10/18,-2,,-2,"The answer to the dark matter dark energy problem comes from a misunderstanding of gravity, or more specifically, the interaction of matter with spacetime. 

Our assumptions in measuring the mass of distant galaxies and stars stems from the constant C and various methods of observation to calculate movement, orbital period, and relative brightness. What is missing is the effects of the ""void"" of space. The void isn't a void, it is permeating with fields that while weakly interact with visible matter, are grand enough to account for the missing mass of the universe. 

The phrase, before the big bang, doesn't make sense in the classical model, however there was existence before the big bang in a universe where these fields created particles and after the big bang, these fields did not stop creating particles. They are just not dense enough for us to measure but they are energetic enough to explain the repulsion forces of the void spaces against galaxies, aiding in the force of gravity by being a sort of pushing force to keep the matter grouped up in clusters vs evenly distributed through space as we see in nature with diffusion.

We are closer to proving and discovering all of these fields and moving into the next phase of research of the cosmos. ",no,view comment

The thing with black holes is they emit no significant amount of radiation (Hawking radiation is an extremely weak process of losing mass-energy, if it even happens). Thus, you can't simply look for black holes like you look for stars, because not only does it not emit light, light doesn't bounce off of it because it sucks it all in forever. 

Thus, you have to make indirect observations. You can't see the black hole itself, you can however see objects in its vicinity acting ""weird"" (all orbiting erractically or orbiting a single big mass that one somehow can't see).

Now, if it expands in various directions in all the possible directions the water would not be pulled by the gravitational force, since the gravitation doesn't exist in the equation of understanding ""dark matter"". Instead, the outer rim of the geometry - it can look like anything - just expands randomly and drags the ""light matter"", in this case the body of water, which makes the water less dense.

300,,Barneyk,03/10/18,18,,18,"One of the biggest argument against our math being wrong as I see it is that the math would have to work differently from galaxy to galaxy our math to be wrong.

If you look at a galaxy and how it behaves and then you tune the math to describe it, that math doesn't work for other galaxies. No matter how much they have tried tuning and fiddling and making the math more and more advanced and adaptable it all just breaks down anyway and is just inaccurate in to many measurements. 

Our current math on the other hand works perfectly everywhere across the entire universe as long as you have dark matter as a variable.

So while people are working on different kinds of math to explain whats going on, every single observation and experiment tells us that our current math is correct but there is a hidden variable which we call black matter.

Another huge argument for dark matter is gravitational lensing. We can observe galaxies that are behind a extra dense cluster of dark matter and the mass from the dark matter bends the light as a lens when we observe it. And so far every observation of this phenomena has been consistent with our prediction of the distribution of dark matter.

There is something there that we can't see that bends the light. That would also have to be explained by some other phenomena if it is just our math that is wrong and dark matter doesn't exist.

Another argument that I use to myself when I feel skeptical about science, if I am skeptical, so where and are a lot of scientist and they have been working for decades trying to come up with a simpler explanation but so far every attempt has just made the probability of dark matter being real go up. (I mostly have to tell this to myself about quantum physics)",no,view comment
301,,Milleuros,03/10/18,7,,7,"That was the first explanation given historically. Some people suggested quite early some missing mass, but it was dismissed as measurement errors or calculation errors. 

Then the evidence started to pile-up. Year after year. It was obviously not a measurement error because everyone was observing the same thing. So it could have been a theory error?

But then, theory showed that it is able to predict phenomena. The maths say that a new phenomena we never observed actually exists, so we build an experiment to test that prediction and surprise, we do find it.  So we know the theory is pretty solid, as it not only describes things we see, but it also describes thing we had never seen. 

What's more puzzling is that all these measurements that are ""off"" would _all_ be correct if there was this missing dark matter, and all experiments point towards the same behaviour of that missing mass and the same quantity with respect to regular matter.  A single hypothesis fixes a whole range of phenomena: stellar orbits in clusters, galaxy rotation, gravitational lensing, galactic orbits in clusters, collisions between galaxies, web-like cosmic structure, and the cosmic microwave background.   When they are all explained with the very same model, that model becomes very interesting. ",no,view comment

358,,jumpedupjesusmose,03/10/18,1,,1,"Thank you. I like that reply. 

Means either leaking gravity is completely wrong or there are a finite number of universes. 

I’ve had this hypothesis that there are a vast but finite number of multiverses, one Planck length apart in space-time. And that we actually perceive say billions of them simultaneously and call it our universe. In the case of a galaxy, the influence is from even more multiverses, quadrillions perhaps.  We call the difference between this galactic influence and our perception “dark matter”.

Cross-section depends on the frequency, right? That's the number I have the hardest time figuring out since I'm not an expert, but I see numbers on the scale of megabarns.

500 lightyears * 1 megabarn * (1 molecule / cm^3) = 473 molecules, just to get out of the disk of the Milky Way. And on that scale, you're not having redshift issues.",no,view comment
361,,[deleted],03/10/18,-1,,-1,"> You can theorize about higher dimensions if you want, but it seems a bit hasty to start reevaluating our fundamental understanding of reality when the solution could easily be much more straightforward.

Other unseen worlds are not higher dimensions. Anymore than 2D flatland isn't a part of 3D land. Okay, that.

Just that our perception won't allow us to resolve / detect it *from our perspective*.

The straight forward answer to 'missing' 3D physical matter is we underestimate how dense singularities and the center of Galaxies really are. Besides the dust between galaxies, and or the super black holes that wander the cosmos unseen, no stars or dust shining to highlight their presences.

Assuming there are super sized stars that become black holes and we see them by their surrounding chaos, why not super sized blackholes that are stable and invisible?

What if theres one of those for every hundred galaxies? Theres the missing matter.

Waiting for James Webb, too...

369,,wadss,04/10/18,1,,1,"to clarify, when i say most gasses, i mean when we want to look at stuff outside of the milky way, we always  choose to look perpendicular to the plane of the disk of the milky way, where there is the least amount of interstellar medium to get in the way.  in that sense, its the stuff we're looking at thats mostly optically thin (depending on the frequency), because we're not considering the stuff in the milky way.

cross section does depend on frequency, but it's not a straightforward relationship.  you have to consider both absorption and scattering.  low energy photons get scattered easily by dust particles their wavelengths are comparable to the size of the dust grains. on the other hand,  you would expect that higher energy photons would have a easier time passing through the ISM, and while thats true that its got a smaller scattering cross section, it could be absorbed more easily.  for instance the lyman-alpha atomic transition of neutral hydrogen, it's really good at absorbing UV photons, and so we can use the dimming of UV photons in a region to determine the density of hydrogen in the area.

but my point is that when we're looking out of the milky way, where redshift is important, we are very careful in looking in a spot where local emission and absorption is a non-factor.",no,view comment
370,,wadss,04/10/18,1,,1,"yes, it's possible.  it's also possible that dark matter are the farts of hyper advanced aliens, or god.  the problem is that when you talk about things like parallel universes, it by definition becomes untestable and unprovable.  which means it's no longer science.  one of the tenants of science is that things are knowable and can be empirically proven through observation.",no,view comment
371,,wadss,04/10/18,2,,2,"thats how science works.  the prevailing theory is one that best supports the observations.  dark matter by far is the best model we currently have that matches all the observations we have of different things in the sky.  and so we're dedicating alot of resources in many fields like particle physics and cosmology to learning more about dark matter.

there is absolutely nothing stopping anyone from coming up with a better model that would fit observations better.  it's just that nobody has been able to do that yet.  there is no absolute truths in science, it's always a work in progress.

and so it's not a stretch to keep anything relevant, but that there are no viable alternative models.  i just don't understand why there are so many people that think they know better than people that have spent 10+ years in university and graduate school learning physics and astronomy.  to refute or contribute to science, you have to first understand what came before and why things are the way they are.   the people that work on MOND are some of the smartest people in the field, because it's much more theoretical in nature vs experimental (observational), and MOND is falling off as a contender vs dark matter because those extremely brilliant minds aren't making progress vs the mounting evidence that support dark matter.

if i come out and claim that ""i think illness is caused by demons and witchcraft. i don't buy that we can actually see bacteria and viruses.""  i'd be treated like an insane person.  just because *i'm* ignorant of the evidence and how we are able to obtain that evidence, doesn't mean that evidence doesn't exist.",no,view comment

thats absolutely right, IF that were the only thing we applied dark matter to.  there are numerous completely unrelated and independent observations and applications of dark matter that has nothing to do with galaxies that ALSO support dark matter in exactly the same way galaxy rotation does.

thats the crux of your and many others misunderstandings.  this isn't just a ""we fudged this thing because galaxy rotation curves doesnt look right"" its much more.  i don't think popular science articles has done a very good job of communicating this fact when writing about dark matter, because the first and often ONLY thing those articles cite are the galaxy rotations.  which naturally begs the same question you brought up.",no,view comment
