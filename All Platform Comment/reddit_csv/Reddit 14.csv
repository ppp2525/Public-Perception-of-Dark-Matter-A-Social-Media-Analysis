In particular, the bullet cluster is usually the example of the smoking gun since it clearly shows a collisionless component distinct from the visible matter/gas.

MOND is decent explanation of some galactic phenomena (but these are very complex anyways and it’s likely we don’t understand everything that goes into galactic dynamics so even when they fit data better than DM it’s hard to see it as strong evidence) but it is very clear that even with MOND you need something else like dark matter and, without compelling theoretical reasons to expect MOND (and dark matter being a tiny change to existing theories) it’s widely held that dark matter is a better explanation than MOND.",no,view comment

46,,forte2718,15/05/23,3,,3,">How does MOND explain it?

As I understand it:  by having a different value for the constant a_0 that MOND introduces.  The value of a_0 must be determined by experiment and sets the scale at which gravitational behavior diverges from GR's predictions and begins to behave in the MOND-unique manner.

A major problem for MOND seems to be that using different galaxies to fix the value of a_0 results in different values that are needed for different galaxies.  Proponents of MOND often argue that needing to fix the amount of dark matter in a galaxy is a problem for dark matter models, but in dark matter models it is expected that the dark matter content of galaxies is variable and fits a statistical distribution (which means outliers are expected).  However, needing different values of a_0 for each galaxy not only fails to improve the situation (as you still need a parameter for each galaxy) but arguably makes the situation worse, as a_0 is supposed to be a universal constant yet observations suggest that it cannot be.  So that then demands explanation and as far as I am aware MOND proponents have yet to come up with a satisfactory one.

""Dark Matter"" is a variable that is always equal to the exact difference between the left and right side of equations.

For example:

Uh oh... that's no good. Wait, I got it!

Post-dark matter ---- 4+2+8+(22)=36

There. Do you see that 22 up there? That's dark matter and that's all it does. It's a ridiculous concept to adhere to without significantly more evidence. The math didn't work out so they just added in the exact value needed to balance the equation and called it dark matter. Then, to cover their bases and further establish its credibility they decided to go with ""its magic"" to alleviate skepticism. 

So.... let me get this straight here. We're settled on ""it doesn't interact with light or normal matter aside from Mathematically in cosmic scale gravitaty calculations and not even all of those, just some""? That's where the smart money lies?
