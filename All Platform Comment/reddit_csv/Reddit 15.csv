17,,d0meson,02/12/22,15,,15,"The difference is that known particles, and the processes that create them, are well studied. And they're not independent of each other, either -- the properties of the various known particles are dependent on each other through a web of interlinked predictions and measurements. 

The existence of such a new process acting only on known particles, that was likely enough to account for what you want it to account for, would have consequences not just for neutrinos but for other things in the Standard Model as well. For example, the width of the mass distribution of observed Z-bosons, something we can measure with decent precision, tells us something about how many neutrino flavors there are. And so far, there have been no discrepancies between the predictions of the Standard Model and experimental observations that are strong enough to suggest any kind of discovery.

So at this point, either the process involves some totally unknown particle that's decoupled from most of the Standard Model, or it's so vanishingly unlikely that it couldn't possibly have significantly influenced the neutrino population.",no,view comment

35,,ketralnis,02/12/22,5,,5,"(moved from [a deeper thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/zarm5u/comment/iyobbl3/))

Equally valid is an extremely strong claim though, and I don't think it holds up. And that's specifically because of the part that you think makes your idea more palatable: we already know quite a lot more about neutrinos. We've already walked a lot more of the solution space around them than we can possibly have walked around an unknown particle.

We have maps of the energies that neutrinos can possibly have, we know that there are 3 generations and how they associate with other leptons and how they interact and we know about their interaction cross sections and chirality and their strange relationship with mass. We know way more about them, so there are entire parts of the ""is it neutrinos?"" configuration space that we know we can cross off.

We also don't know if it's a bunch of stray cats flying around space, right? Except we do know a fair amount about cats, and what we do know pretty well rules them out. Maybe there's a whole unknown cat-production process out there in space, sure. If you demanded that I prove that it's *not* space-felines, I'd find that pretty hard. It's an option, but the data we have makes it a lot less likely.

We don't know any of that about dark matter, or at least a lot less of it. We don't know if it interacts weakly but we do know that it doesn't interact electromagnetically. We don't know if it's [a lot of small particles or a small number of big ones](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~george/ay20/eaa-wimps-machos.pdf). We don't know if it comes in generations or if there's an entire dark sector with dark forces. There's a lot more unsearched configuration space here that we don't have explicit rule-outs for yet.

I suspect a more direct answer would be non-detection of slow-moving neutrinos given experiments that might be able to detect them and/or differentiate them from fast-moving neutrinos, if such things are possible.

Alternatively, it's worth considering whether thermalization processes via electro-weak interactions in the early universe should have given any slow-moving neutrinos in the early universe more energy. 

What's been offered is ""we don't know of any slow-neutrino producing processes"", which is actually a pretty decent response, but it might be possible to address it more directly via non-observation of expected effects.",no,view comment

No. You make a hypothesis and *you* take the lead in learning and trying to prove it wrong. You can't just turn up and demand proof from others when you're suggesting a new idea in each comment (and without any math to actually be precise about what you're proposing).

FYI, the scientific content of your questions are reasonable. Your tone is sometimes ok, but sometimes not. Asking a question like ""can you show me why this is"" is fine, but saying just ""prove it"" or ""why not?"" is considered rude in English.

As others have said, sterile neutrinos **are** a possible dark matter candidate. However no experiment so far has shown repeatable evidence for their existence, nor ruled them out (if they interact via the weak force, we would see that; that's what the experiments are designed for); so at the moment they're roughly as likely as any other dark matter candidate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_neutrino#Detection_attempts, https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/9650/sterile-neutrinos-as-dark-matter?rq=1, etc. Of course neutrino detection in general is quite difficult, let alone a hypothetical sterile neutrino, so most of these measurements have quite large error bars. Standard neutrinos are not a good candidate by themselves because standard-neutrino-detection experiments measure roughly the amount we expect *without* accounting for dark matter.

In general, dark matter candidates which do interact via the weak force are known as WIMPs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particle). You can read much more on the topic by searching that term.",no,view comment
46,,eldahaiya,03/12/22,13,,13,"u/MaoGo is right: there are only so many neutrinos you can pack inside galaxies due to the Pauli exclusion principle, and that number of neutrinos would be too little to account for all of dark matter in our galaxy. This is known as the Tremaine Gunn bound ([https://theoretical-physics-digest.fandom.com/wiki/Tremaine\_Gunn\_Bound](https://theoretical-physics-digest.fandom.com/wiki/Tremaine_Gunn_Bound)), and a careful study of it using the smallest dark matter structures we know of says that if dark matter is made up of fermions, it has to have a mass of at least a keV or so. Neutrinos are definitely lighter than 1 eV, so they're out as dark matter, from this fact alone.

u/slashdave also points out another problem: how do you produce slow neutrinos in the early universe? Every neutrino has to be thermally coupled to the Standard Model at high enough temperatures (because interaction rates with electrons/protons/neutrons just become too high, it's unavoidable), and we know that the thermally coupled neutrinos are too fast to be the dark matter. You would have to cook up a way of producing neutrinos out of equilibrium temperatures below an MeV, without messing up Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and get the dark matter to appear in time for the CMB. This is very difficult, and will be very baroque. Anyway, point (1) kills you outright.

Neutrinos do have lots of attractive properties to be dark matter though, which is why keV scale sterile neutrinos are a popular candidate of dark matter.",no,view comment

51,,legsylexi,03/12/22,2,,2,"Neutrinos were actually one of the big initial candidates for dark matter, because of the fact they are so weakly interacting!

However, there is an issue. We know how much dark matter there should be - this is known as the dark matter relic density, and it's 0.12 - and we can work out how what neutrinos would give for this relic density based on their interaction with other Standard Model particles, and their behaviour in the early universe. The neutrino relic density is the sum of the mass of the active neutrinos divided by 100 eV. This means in order for neutrinos to make up all of dark matter they must have a total summed mass of around 12 eV.

HOWEVER, there is another bound, called the Tremaine-Gunn bound, that tells us how heavy fermionic dark matter must be in order for the structure formation we see to occur. This bound says that fermionic dark matter must be AT LEAST 120 eV or heavier in order to create the universe we see today. 

Hence, neutrinos can't be dark matter, because the relic density requires them to have a mass of around on 12eV in order for them to be the dark matter component (any more than this and there would be too much dark matter), but the Tremaine-Gunn bound says that fermionic dark matter MUST be at least 120 eV (you can have lighter dark matter, it just can't be fermionic). 

Hence, active neutrinos cannot make up the dominant component of dark matter.",no,view comment
