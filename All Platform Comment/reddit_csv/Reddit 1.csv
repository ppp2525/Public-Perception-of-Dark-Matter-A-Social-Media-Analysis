2,,Davidjb7,18/02/21,14,,14,"To answer your question more clearly than some other answers: It depends on the theory! 

For instance, I worked on a team at Indiana University that studied Axions which are a candidate for dark matter. The theory we were specifically testing essentially told us that there was some non-zero probability that Axions were around us at any given moment. Additionally, the theory predicted that these Axions would act in very particular ways! By designing an experiment that systematically eliminated external variables and focused in on the single action which the theory predicted, we were able to disprove that very specific axion theory in the parameter space we were approaching. 

Part of the issue with many of these theories which predict dark matter and exotic particles is that currently they aren't ""falsifiable"". All that means is that within the constructs of the theory, there is no currently realizable experimental setup that can give you a negative response. For example: If I say there is a unicorn on the roof that blesses me, it is very simple for you to disprove this theory by walking outside and looking and then relaying to me that there isn't a unicorn there. A more difficult theory though is that there is a unicorn on the roof that becomes invisible whenever you look at it! This once again can be solved by putting cameras outside and watching the roof. Finally, if I say there is a perfectly invisible unicorn on the roof that is invisible because light does not interact with it, you might be truly be stymied. If a theory, in its convolutions, does not make predictions which can be checked and tested against, then in my biased experimentalist opinion it isn't worth a damn. 

That being said, Dark Matter, in many of its iterations, is a testable entity and it is only a matter of time until we prove/disprove it.",no,view comment

Dark energy is a theoretical explanation as to why the universe is expanding at an increasing rate. We know the universe is expanding which means it must have originated from a central point. We call this the Big Bang. If something explodes it expands and slows down eventually.

25,,OliverSparrow,18/02/21,7,,7,"There are literally dozens of theories about DM, and literally dozens of problems with explanations for DE. The two taken together are required to raise the energy density of the universe sufficiently to make it ""flat"", which other observations prove it to be. Conventional matter accounts for only 5% of the mass density that is needed. 

DM is needed if equations describing gravity are to be correct. If they are lightly modified - MOND - then it isn't needed. Only a few observations are not wiped away if MOND is true. The Tully Fisher relationship - between galaxy brightness and rotation rate - is stronger if DM is excluded. 

If MOND is incorrect, however, then we need a particle that feels only gravity. You can't detect it because it doesn't interact with your detector, and gravity is a very weak force that it is indetectable from individual particles. Nevertheless, tanks of xenon await literal bumps and collisions from DM, and have so far failed to find them. The favoured particle is the axion, a theoretical particle that has never been detected but which should have the right characteristics: very light but with mass, present in vast numbers. So light is the axion that its wave function should be large - metres in length - delocating the particle in spacetime. There are notions of blobs of axions, called fuzzballs,, but like their parent these have never been seen.

Dark energy is evident in the accelerated pace with which galaxies are retreating from each other. We know that the early universe had to go through a period of extremely fast expansion, termed 'inflation'. What drove inflation is not known, but it is thought to be a field that was curled up or under tension at the Big Bang but which unwound very quickly, ripping spacetime open. DE is likely the residue of this field, although why is exists today with the strength that it shows is not at all clear. There are all manner of model as to what teh inflaton field was and how it acted. One of the more alarming is quintessence, which ahs DE as intrinsic to a given volume of space. As the universe expands, so quintessence outgrows matter, increasing the strength of DE without limit. A Big Rip is inherent to the theory, pulling elementary particles appart a few billion years into the future. As it is ripping space *time*, what an exponentially expanding time would be like is anyone's guess. The core of a black hole, presumably, where similar things (perhaps) happen.",no,view comment

> If dark energy is constant all around us do that mean that there is no dark energy outside of visible universe because otherwise dark energy in all directions should cancel itself out? 

So as I understand dark energy, it is (in theory) creating new space. So there would be dark energy outside the visible universe (along with stars and gravity and everything else), but it is creating new space _everywhere_. The result is that we see the visible universe expanding faster and faster, and an observer outside our visible universe would see the same thing.

> Does dark energy apply a force 1/r2 from empty space or is the force constant?

I don't know whether dark energy would fall off with the inverse square law (maybe?). But it should exist at a low level everywhere, including space that has stuff in it. So you wouldn't really notice if it did. Everywhere you measured you should get the same level of dark energy. It's just that in the space within galaxies, dark energy is easily overpowered by gravity.

> Is the dark matter force vector on earth known based on out position and speed in the galaxy?

Good question! At a guess, I would say yes. We know how fast we are orbiting the center of the Milky Way, so we know how much extra gravity their must be to keep us from flying off. That said, this is getting into the math deeper than I am familiar with, so I am not sure of any exact numbers.

> Do galaxies rotate fixed like a solid planet or with variable angular velocity like the solar system?

Stars orbit the center of galaxies with variable angular velocity. The large-scale structures we see like arms are not fixed, they are density waves slowly circling around. Like waves in water, no one water molecule is a part of a wave. Instead the wave passes through the molecules, each of which have their own motion.

When a particular theory makes a lot of good predictions it gets adopted until something better comes along.

Dark matter is an example of the predictions failing. This is very interesting. It indicates there is something we don't know. It absolutely could be that what we don't know is how gravity behaves at galactic scales. It wouldn't be the first time we have had to refine our understanding of gravity.

This merger was only announced in September 2020, and I actually hadn't heard of it yet, so thanks for bringing it to my attention. That's pretty awesome.

But yeah. For IMBHs to explain dark matter, they would probably have to be primordial. Created in the big bang in large numbers, and never having been stars at all. Seems like this May 2019 event could be explained by two stellar black holes merging.

The most compelling impetus for ""finding"" dark matter is that it resolves a rather important question with our understanding of physics. As a matter of fact, the amount of matter we cannot see or interact with, but exerts gravitational force nonetheless, outweighs normal matter several times over. Effectively we are seeing and measuring only a narrow slice of the matter we know has to exist, because we can see it's effects.

There is a tendency to assign certain properties based on the words ""dark matter"" or ""dark energy"" but the truth is that those words may as well be something less catchy.

As for detecting them, the interactions we detect from neutrinos are not related to their (very small) mass. Rather, they have a very very small chance of occasionally colliding with other atoms, and when they do they release a bit of energy which we can detect.

WIMPs might well _never_ collide with anything ever. Even if they are very massive. If they do collide, but just very rarely, we might be able to detect them in a similar way to neutrinos, and some experiments have been set up to that effect, but they have yet to spot anything.

If they don't collide ever, that makes them much harder to detect, but we still might be able to detect them solely by their mass. As they pass by they should have a very very small gravitational effect.

So a hypothetical WIMP could be in that same range, or potentially an order of magnitude or two outside it. I believe some of our experiments have ruled out some masses and narrowed down the possibilities, but I am not sure off the top of my head what those ranges are.

The theoretical expectation is that the DM distribution in a galactic halo follows a Navarro-Frenk-White profile ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro%E2%80%93Frenk%E2%80%93White_profile); [reference](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...462..563N/abstract)). In this profile the density rises steeply toward the centre of the galaxy, just as the baryonic (""normal"") matter density does.

What is different between DM and baryons is that the DM density falls less steeply at large radii than the baryons do. This is exactly what is needed to explain the [flat rotation curves](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Rotation_curve_of_spiral_galaxy_Messier_33_%28Triangulum%29.png).",no,view comment
68,,nivlark,18/02/21,1,,1,"The main constraint on the dark matter particle mass is that DM needs to be ""cold"", which is a term used to mean that even at the high temperatures (i.e. average particle kinetic energies) present in the early universe, the DM particle was sufficiently massive that the rest energy associated with its mass dominated over the kinetic energy, so the particle never behaved relativistically.

This is what first ruled out regular neutrinos as dark matter candidates - their small masses would make them ""hot"" DM, and this produces different predictions for the way cosmic structures form that are in conflict with the observations.",no,view comment

The current best model for dark energy is something called the ""cosmological constant"", which does have exactly the same density everywhere, and so more of this is ""created"" as expansion proceeds.

71,,tinyLEDs,18/02/21,10,,10,"> Basically if you wanted to make a new theory to explain gravity, it would need to consistently explain all these effects

I think the question that u/jrrybock is getting at is that, sure, we understand and have composed a durable theory about how gravity acts upon observable matter... BUT! ... How is any sort of consensus maintained around the effects of (supposedly) the same force acting upon matter that is (a) non-observable, and (b) known to behave in no predictable manner? 

In other words, an assumption is made that (gravity acting upon observable matter) ~ (gravity acting upon non-observable, non-understood matter) .... how is this leap of logic substantiated?   What makes the assumption convincing enough to hang research and credibility on it?

72,,ncburbs,18/02/21,12,,12,"I think once you gain more familiarity with the field you will understand better. It's not as simple as you've put forth - there has been a TON of effort put forth into experiments to validate our current theory of gravity, and it's come through looking really good. So you could throw away this theory, but any alternative theory you might propose (and that hasn't already been disproven) that doesn't rely on dark matter, would actually have way more unexplained and unknowns than our current theory.

Edit: another comment had this well put from wiki

>A problem with alternative hypotheses is observational evidence for dark matter comes from so many independent approaches. Explaining any individual observation is possible but explaining all of them is very difficult. Nonetheless, there have been some scattered successes for alternative hypotheses, such as a 2016 test of gravitational lensing in entropic gravity and a 2020 measurement of a unique MOND effect.

>The prevailing opinion among most astrophysicists is while modifications to general relativity can conceivably explain part of the observational evidence, there is probably enough data to conclude there must be some form of dark matter.

If you mean, could the mathematical model be incorrect in a way that leads one to incorrectly conclude that dark matter exists - then yes, that is possible. That's kind of tautological, though:  if some effect other than dark matter better explains our observations, the models that led us to conclude that dark matter exists are by definition incorrect.

What you are linking to is the gravitational lensing of other galaxies and clusters as they pass in front of quasars or other more distant galaxies. More important than the lensing itself, is _how much_ lensing there is. This is effectively a way to measure the mass of these galaxies/clusters. No surprise, they seem to have much too much gravity for their visible matter.

That however isn't an argument for MACHOs. WIMPs would also explain this lensing. Any theory that puts extra mass in galaxies would. It is decent evidence that the whole gravity-being-broken thing is not the right explanation though.",no,view comment

For example, we've measured the masses of distant galaxies using gravitational lensing, and they seem to have a bunch of extra masses.

We've also detected a handful of galaxies which seem to have been drained of their dark matter. Tough to explain how that happens if there isn't extra matter to drain.",no,view comment

95,,stenlis,19/02/21,1,,1,">Assuming WIMPs are the explanation for dark matter, since they don’t collide with anything they would not settle into a disk like visible matter has.

I'm a bit confused by this. The way I learned formation of star systems the disk structure is formed by giving the initial cloud a spin. Without the spin the cloud would have a tendency to just collapse in itself but with the spin in place the angular momentum of the particles close to the ""equator"" will keep them from drifting in so the cloud will collapse into a disk.

Collisions are not involved in this process.

Thanks.",no,view comment
97,,delventhalz,19/02/21,2,,2,"Sounds like what you were told was correct, just incomplete.

So in your version of things, you have a cloud of material, and it starts to collapse under its own weight. Overall, the motion of the material averages out to rotation in some direction or another, and as the cloud collapses, that weak initial rotation speeds up like figure skater pulling in their arms. Thanks to centripetal force, gravity is partially resisted along the plane of rotation, but wins everywhere else, and the cloud becomes a disk.

The reason this story is incomplete, is because it only really works if the cloud starts motionless. We think of things in space as just sort of floating around, so intuitively that makes sense, but the reality is quite the opposite. Things in space are always moving. Fast. This is why gravity does not cause the Earth to crash into the Sun. We're moving, and that movement keeps us in a stable orbit.

Similarly, a cloud of material is not motionless. The contents are whizzing about at various speeds and various orbits. So how does gravity win? Friction. When two particles collide, they lose a bit of speed, and they fall a bit closer to the center. As more and more collisions occur, gravity wins more and more, and the disk structure emerges through the process you outlined.

But what happens if collisions are impossible or at least exceedingly rare? Gravity doesn't win. Particles just keep flying around. Without friction, they never lose speed, and if they never lose speed, they will never fall in. Gravity will bend their path into some sort of orbit, like the Earth, but the particles cannot actually be pulled closer without friction. So the cloud stays and you never get a disk.",no,view comment
