2,,WillieJamesOnReddit,16/03/17,4,,4,This may not be that helpful. I'm currently taking Physics With Calculus at my university and a student asked this question and the professor made it sound like we found those numbers based on the Volume of the known universe. He compared it to a plastic bag filled with various gasses and being able to find out how much of the gas in the bag was O2 And related it by saying we based our estimation on what we can see we estimate that only 4% of the known universe is Matter ,no,view comment
3,,Roldale24,16/03/17,300,,300,"We know this, because we can calculate, estimate really, the mass/energy of the universe, or at least parts of space. We also can determine mass/energy of things we can see. These two number are nowhere near each other. 
For example. You have a weightless piggy bank. You look into the piggy bank, and you can see 3 quarters and a dime. You weigh this piggy bank, and it weighs 35 pounds. You logically determine that under no circumstances can 4 coins weigh that much. No amount of error or scale calibration can cause that much error. Therefore, you determine that there is something else in the piggy bank you can't see. This is dark matter. We can measure its impact on the world. I.E. it's weight in the piggybank, but can't see it or directly measure it. The calculations that arrive at the exact percentages are guesses. Good ones mind you, but estimates none the less. Going back to the piggy bank example, it weighs 35 pounds, and the coins (for simplicities sale) weigh a pound. We can determine that the dark matter makes up 34 pounds of our piggy bank, or %97. And the matter, or  coins, make up %3. The reason accuracy is impeded is because we can't measure the mass of the coins exactly, but we know for sure there is a MASSIVE discrepancy.

4,,StarkillerX42,16/03/17,278,,278,"There are two very different components to this answer. Before I get into it, let's define the everyday stuff you encounter, every molecule, atom, quark, etc. we know about is called baryonic matter. Now in astrophysics, it's not bad to assume all baryonic matter is hydrogen, which burns in stars. Thus, baryonic matter is bright and we can see it in a lot of ways.

Now part 1 is the dark matter to baryonic matter ratio. Vera Rubin discovered this wild method of measuring the mass of galaxies via their rotational rates. Essentially, based on the speed at certain distances from the core, you can calculate where the mass in concentrated. We expected the mass to decrease as you get further from a galactic core because that is how the light drops off which is consistent with our explanations of baryonic matter. However, we find that there is more mass further out than we expected, meaning there is matter we cannot see that must be there. Because it doesn't interact with light, it must be dark. We're making a lot of progress in identifying dark matter, but it's very weird to think about.

Next we need to talk about the ratio of dark energy to everything else. I'm not a cosmologist, so I don't know much about this, but essentially the universe is expanding. We know this thanks to Hubble and everything we can see confirms it. However, we recently discovered that the universe is now expanding faster than it used to, ie. The universe is accelerating. Now this makes no sense because the expansion of the universe is defined as the expansion of space between things, so in order for this to be accelerating, something must exist intrinsically inside space to cause an acceleration. Energy is what you call something that causes expansion, so it must be energy. We can quantify it because we know how the universe is expanding, but we know almost nothing about what this thing really is.

Also, it is worth noting that dark energy could also be considered dark mass because of Einstein's mass energy equivalence of E=mc^2. But that being said, this is a super nebulous explanation of a super nebulous argument that physics struggles to explain.

So even if we can get a good ratio of these things, we aren't very close to understanding them. Another misconception is that dark matter and dark energy are related. This is actually completely false. They have very different properties with almost no overlap and they're only dark because we've never seen them.",no,view comment

18,,BrazenNormalcy,16/03/17,14209,,14209,"We can see galaxies and (with the Hubble telescope) see the speed at which they rotate.  We can also calculate how much the stars in those galaxies mass.  The problem is, that much matter, spinning at those speeds, would fly apart.  Even adding in planets, dust, and black holes, there still isn't enough matter in galaxies to hold them together.  Not even nearly enough.  There shouldn't even be galaxies anymore, just scattered stars.  But there *are* still galaxies, so *something* we can't see must hold them together.  

The leading contender for that *something* is matter that doesn't interact with normal matter or energy but does create gravity like normal matter.  We call that hypothetical *something* dark matter, and we're trying to figure out what it is.  

From observing the movements of galaxies and the apparent mass they contain, we can approximate how much gravity would hold them together, and that gives us the amount of dark matter.
 
Dark energy comes from a different observation about the universe. There is a type of supernova called 1A, which is an exploding white dwarf star.  Since white dwarfs explode at a certain mass, the explosions are always about the same, and each 1A supernova is pretty much the same brightness and color spectrum as the next.  

Since they're the same brightness, we can calculate how far away they are by how faint they appear.  Since they're the same color, we can calculate how fast they're moving away from us - the faster a star moves away from us, the redder it appears- we call that its *redshift*.  (Although, regardless of the speed or direction its source is moving, light always moves at the same speed, movement toward us compresses the light's wavelength, making the light appear bluer, while movement away stretches that wavelength, making it appear redder.)

If the universe started all together and then moved apart at a constant rate, then we would expect the redshift - how fast it's moving away - to be the same for nearby galaxies as well as distant ones. But fainter (more distant) 1A supernovae aren't red enough.  Since we're seeing those distant ones as they were when the universe was very young, that tells us the universe was expanding at a slower rate back then.  And the further back in time we look, the slower expansion was at that time.

So the universe's expansion has been speeding up.  But *something* must be speeding it up.  What?  Nothing we can detect.  Since speeding up as we know it is always caused by energy, we call this undetectable something dark energy.

Calculating how much the expansion has accelerated, and how much energy it would take to do that to all those galaxies, gives us an approximation of the amount of dark energy. 


**TLDR: We get the amount of dark matter from how much extra gravity it would take to keep galaxies from flying apart.  We get the amount of dark energy from how much energy it would take to accelerate the expansion of the universe at the rate we see it happening.**",no,view comment

This happens because the geometry of objects drawn on a flat surface is different than the same object drawn on a sphere.  However, if an object on a sphere is drawn at a small enough scale it may appear to have the same properties as one drawn on a flat surface.

The dark energy effect is tiny on objects as small as a solar system (if it wasn't we'd have spotted it earlier).

Edit: for anyone interested, since the stars in the galaxy orbit the galactic centre at a roughly constant distance, the force pulling them towards the centre (gravity) needs to be equal to the force throwing them outwards (centrifugal force). 
For clarity, centrifugal force is not a 'real' force, but that is another story.
Setting the equations of these two forces equal to each other, manipulating the equation to express orbital velocity as an expression of distance and using the mass of the visible matter in the galaxy produces a 'Rotation Curve', just a graph of how the velocity of the stars changes with respect to the distance from the centre. At least, this curve would be correct if visible matter was the ONLY matter contributing to the mass of the galaxy.
However, what we observe by measuring the orbital speed of stars is that most of the stars, especially ones at the outer edges of the galaxy, are orbiting far too fast and their centrifugal force should far exceed the gravitational force holding them in, so they should have flown off. Therefore there must be some 'missing mass' in the galaxy that we cannot see or detect since it does not interact with light or normal matter (aside from gravitationally, of course) hence the name DARK matter.",no,view comment

As galaxies form and move, baryonic matter coalesces due to gravity, but dark matter interacts only with gravity.  So, it hangs out with baryonic matter like a cloud around it, influencing it, but no collisions like when two baryonic clusters smash into each other.  Because of this, we get the Abell 520 observation, and depending upon the age and stability of the dark matter that's moving like an elastic cloud, following or leading baryonic matter/galaxies, the dark matter could be either lead, lag or stable with an area of space like a galaxy, cluster, etc.  More energetic galaxies that are still moving relatively quickly due to past interactions may behave more irregular due to the dark matter being unstable in the location of the center of mass relative to the baryonic cluster's center of mass.  Since the location of dark matter relative to baryonic in a galaxy can vary, but not be easily observed, and change over time as it settles closer to the galaxy, it may change it's influence on how it can be observed, and how the galaxy behaves.  For instance, it may add a significant moment to the galaxy, causing it to wobble.  In the case of Abell 520, if there was one collision, followed by another before the cloud of dark matter could be hovering at some distance before settling back close to the baryonic center, so when the second collision occurs, the dark matter and baryonic matter become ""detached.""

I start with that statement, because dark matter and dark energy, technically, are still a theory. The same as the Theory of Gravity. 

We have a pretty good understanding of Gravity, but, it is still a theory.

When dark matter was first proposed in 1933, it was a theory. 

It was proposed, because our working knowledge of physics and mathematics could not account for the missing matter needed, for distant galaxies to work properly. How were they not spinning apart? They only contained 1% of the matter needed for gravity to hold them together... So Fitz Zwicky guessed that there is a made-up something else. 

While the idea was compelling, and lots of research and theory has gone into the idea, 84 years later... We still have no proof of Dark Matter's existence. 

The ""proof"" that is used is ""there must be matter that we cannot detect that we cannot see, that we cannot study, for OUR math and physics to work!"" ...

84 years ... And still no dark matter. 

Color me a realist, but I think we are just slightly wrong in our understanding of Gravity, and physics.

Today, it's technically still a theory, because no one has proof. It hasn't been found. 

""Dark Energy"" was theorized in 1998, and was explained much better in the top comment by /u/BrazenNormalcy regarding type IA Supernovae. 

I stress again, that no one, especially physicists and mathematicians like being wrong. 

And it's highly possible that they are.

As far as Einstein's cosmological constant goes, that's an interesting story. At the time, it was a widely held belief that the universe was static. It was this size, always had been, always will be. So when the equations that fell out of Einstein's general theory of relativity suggested that the universe was not static, but expanding, he thought he had done something wrong. He added the cosmological constant to ""fix"" his equations to force them to produce a static universe. 
It's kinda hard to believe how one of the greatest physicists of all time was so closed minded about the possibility of a widely accepted theory being wrong and to even go as far as to add a constant into an equation for no reason other than to make it fit with this.
Anyway, when it became apparent that the universe WAS expanding, Einstein abandoned his cosmological constant, even reportedly calling it the ""biggest blunder of his life.""
Now, the cosmological constant is being used to explain the force seemingly counteracting gravity, dark energy.
So, Einstein was essentially accidentally correct. He added a constant for entirely the wrong reason, only to have it help explain dark energy further down the line. The question now is the value of the cosmological constant since this will tell us the ""shape"" of the universe, whether it is flat, spherical or hyperbolic (like a Pringle) pretty much determines the future of the universe.",no,view comment

185,,[deleted],16/03/17,39,,39,"I want to make some general comments to reply to a whole host of lower-rated comments that are dominating the discussion down here below the actual answers.

""Dark matter"" really literally does mean *matter* that is *dark.* It is not simply a placeholder name or a vague metaphor. It could actually be as simple as huge masses of unassociated planet- or star- like objects drifting out there in the void between galaxies where it's *literally too dark* to see them. This (MACHOs) is a somewhat unlikely theory, but can't be ruled out. The leading theory (WIMPs) is that much of the substance of the universe is taken up in particles that bear mass, and so interact gravitationally with baryonic matter, but are electromagnetically inert. Many of you will be aware that literally trillions of [neutrinos](http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~larson/Webpage/neutrinos.html) pass through each of our bodies every second; these theoretical WIMPs would be very much like neutrinos, except slower moving so that they can hang around in clumps around galaxies instead of flying along out of all but the very strongest gravity wells. (One of the strongest candidate theoretical particles for dark matter is actually called the [neutralino.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralino))

There is this ongoing meme that ""dark matter"" is just a modern [*virtus dormitiva,*](http://everything2.com/title/Dormitive+virtue) an impressive but vacuous label pasted over a lack of understanding. **This is false.** We have specific theoretical and observational reasons to believe that dark matter *is matter that is dark,* not some quirk of gravitational law:

* Our current laws of gravity are not just empirically curve-fitted to match observations. They ""fall out"" inevitably once certain very high-level and abstract assumptions about the nature of space-time are made. No-one has proposed any alternative theory that matches observations at least as well as Einsteinian general relativity while also having this property of ""looking like"" a legitimate fundamental theory. They're all just kludges. We seem far more entitled to add ""kludges"" to our inherently limited and incomplete telescopic observations of that portion of the universe which is visible to us in the electromagnetic spectrum than we do to add kludges to fundamental, abstract physical laws.

* We have at least some direct observational evidence that refutes non-dark-matter explanations of the anomaly in galaxy rotation rates. The [Bullet Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster#Significance_to_dark_matter) is a galactic collision that has caused stars and galaxies to spatter out in all directions in a pattern that looks *exactly* as if the galaxies' dark matter halos are really there and interacting gravitationally, and that seems to be *impossible* to explain without invoking such halos of dark matter. Since the 2006 Bullet Cluster observations there have been several other similar collisions observed. Admittedly, the interpretation of these observations is complex, and diehard opponents of the dark matter theory have attempted to poke holes in them. You really need to be an actual cosmologist to judge the resulting debates independently, but it is clear that almost everyone in the field thinks they really do refute non-dark-matter theories.

* We don't have to do any kind of violence to the [standard model of particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) to make room for WIMPs. There are actually several different places in the model where we can plausibly fit candidate particles that have the necessary properties to be dark matter. It is true that the experimentalists have started to eliminate some of these candidates, including [one that seemed almost ""miraculously"" plausible,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) but there is still a lot of room in the model.

216,,NoRestWhenWicked,16/03/17,2,,2,"Ok. So. 

1) Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Not matter. Matter gets hella destroyed, often. All radioactivity is matter decaying. (But the mass is what gets conserved. Think of it like the building blocks will never go away, even though the assembled sets come and go.)

A really cool phenomenon to read about is an antimatter supernova. What happens is a star gets so big that it starts smashing some of the heaviest elements, which produce gamma rays (a type of radiation) in their production. This can lead to the creation of positron-electron pairs (electrons and their antimatter equivalent). When that happens, it can cause a runaway thermonuclear reaction, blowing up all of the matter the star had spent its entire lifetime creating back into the most basic parts. Antimatter explosions produce some of the most brilliant spectacles in the universe. 

2) Antimatter has not been proven to be a better source of energy than matter. We really have zero good explanations as to why there would be more matter than antimatter in the universe. What we ARE starting to realize is that there may not be as big of an imbalance as we had originally estimated. 

We have recently discovered that light produced in an antimatter system would look exactly identical to a matter system. This means there very well may be entire galaxies that are predominantly antimatter, existing on the outskirts of clusters of matter galaxy groups, where they do not interact to annihilate. As of yet, we cannot prove this theory, but recent research has at least made us aware it is possible.

DARK matter and antimatter are two totally separate things. Matter and antimatter are equivalents.

Dark matter has no known features. We literally know nothing about it, other than the inference that it must exist. 

We inferred the existence of dark matter like this:

Galaxies we saw out in space were spinning too fast to make sense for our math. We could get a pretty accurate idea of how much mass the galaxies contained, and could form from that a pretty fair assessment of how fast they should be spinning. They were spinning 96%(ish) faster than what our best logic could account for, so someone pipped up an idea about how there must be more matter that we could not see. Hence, the term Dark Matter was born.

The idea was further backed up by the equation of light as it traveled across space. Basically, we could see that light was bending 90%(ish) more than the matter it passed by could account for. Large bodies of matter will typically pull light off course, as even light is pulled towards these giant bodies (gravitational lensing),  but we realized it was being pulled way too much for the visible matter we could account for. 

So we had two, concurrent, related problems with our math and the behavior of the universe, and invented Dark Matter as the solution, and have been trying to prove it ever since.

There is zero real evidence to date. There is also the redefinition of dark matter into parts dark energy and other dark phenomenon to try to make it all make sense. It's currently all just mainstream pseudoscience which is garnering quite a bit of money for the scientific community, so people are content to leave the search open.",no,view comment

Maybe one day the ever illusive quantum explanation for gravity will be discovered. People are working on it and if they are successful and find something tangible, it will be a huge step forward in the field.
But for now the simplest explanation is dark matter/energy. 
Also, if we could find some way to detect dark matter (if it is even detectable) then that would go a long way to improving what we know about it too.

Also, there are multiple lines of evidence that result in dark matter. For example, gravitational lensing also shows an excess of mass in open space that exactly matches what is expected from galaxy rotations.

There's probably virtually no dark matter in Earth (even assuming ""cold dark matter"" which is the popular hypothesis), because it doesn't interact electromagnetically. It will generally interact through gravity, which is an extremely weak force, and earth just doesn't have that big of a gravity well. 

Any dark matter we plow through will have its orbit changed a little as it goes through us. There's nothing to ""stop"" it and make it stay in the Earth.

263,,pm_me_ur_hamiltonian,17/03/17,1,,1,"General relativity says that the expansion of space is driven by the density of its contents. And when the scale of space changes, so does the density of its contents as a result. Now, **the density of matter and the density of dark energy have two different responses when the scale of space changes, and because of that, they have two different effects on the rate of expansion**. If the volume of a region doubles, the density of matter in that region is halved. On the other hand, dark energy does not lose density even while space is expanding. When space expands, new dark energy appears and fills it. Because of these two different responses, a universe will expand differently depending on the ratio of matter and dark energy in that universe. This is observed by surveying distant galaxies.

That yields the total amount of matter in the universe, both dark and atomic. So how do scientists distinguish between dark and atomic matter? There are many methods. One is to measure the variance of local densities in the universe. Atomic matter emits light, loses energy, and falls down into galaxies. Dark matter does not emit light, retains energy, and does not collapse to the same degree as atomic matter. This has a large effect on how galaxies form and change over time.

Dark matter can only interact with normal matter through gravity out of all the 4 forces, which means it can't interact through EM waves (light). Therefore it literally can't block/reflect/absorb light. All light would just pass through it like it's not there. 

>can you really tell me that 'we can't find it' is a satisfactory answer? Why are we not re-examining our model instead?

That is the current best theory that the majority believe should be the case, based on all current observations. Others have formulated their own theories to explain gravity AND include the 'dark matter' data discrepancy. However, a theory of gravity must be able to match all data in every other phenomenon, not just galaxy's rotation. So far, no theories have been more successful in doing that than Einstein's GR, and all of them would require much more unproven assumptions to be made. So the best model we now have is GR + dark matter.

267,,[deleted],17/03/17,1,,1,"You're saying dark matter helps link galaxies into gravitational relationships, and it is decaying in some way causing an acceleration of the escape velocity of every galaxy from themselves? I think this isn't quite right, because we've observed galaxy collisions and from what I remember, the interstellar dust and gas within each galaxy ends up stopping in place as if it were glued to something while the stars of the galaxy fly on through with the cores, and that sticky trap ended up being dark matter from each of the galaxies holding the small debris in place. If it were associated with inter-galactic behavior, then it stands to reason we would see more tracts of inter-galactic dust and debris that is pulled along in rivers/channels between relatively close galaxies.

I think the best bet for explaining away dark energy would be to toy with escape velocities and coriolis effects, say once so much mass has drifted past a certain horizon then the inter-galactic center of mass is redistributed to a perpendicular vector relative to the former center-of-mass escape vector, allowing its acceleration to the future center of mass to equally accelerate from all other relatively equally distant points. Then all you would need is to properly define dark matter and our models would solidly predict pretty much every spatial attribute we can measure and observe.

I wouldn't think too much on it though, it's highly unlikely that a theory like this hasn't been completely explored and that's why we're still calling those forces what they are for the moment.

As for the coriolis effect i mentioned, look at the top gif on the wikipedia for it and imagine the ""down"" vector as being center of mass, aside from the initial approach of the ball to the red dot, it looks very much like an acceleration as it nears the edge.

It could be a tiny force that dark matter takes advantage of in the way i described changing the center of mass and wide scale orbital characteristics, making its effect look more drastic than it is, usurping the power that dark matter presents in the universe by hiding it in a lesser force.

My personal opinion is that neutrinos are virtual mass particles that decay once their out of a certain level of gravitational field density, basically creating moments of virtual gravity on the outer bands of any given galactic disk. Since stars give off neutrinos, this correlates nicely with the mass of the galaxy, possibly even how galactic disks form since all of the mass of the galactic disk could withstand a strong pulse of gravity but outside the disk, the isolated clusters of mass wouldn't be able to mitigate the energy and over long periods, be either demolished or assimilated into the disk where the gravitational foundation is more stable. This would mean dark energy and dark matter are simplifications of the microcosm onto the larger orders of the universe.
