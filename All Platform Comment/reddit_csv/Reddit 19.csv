2,,SecureThruObscure,10/08/13,34,,34,"Dark, in this context, means ""not understood,"" or ""vague,"" sort of the opposite of ""known."" 

So dark matter is unknown matter.  We know *something* with mass exists, and we know that something isn't like Planets, Stars and the matter they're made up of.  This matter accounts for most of the mass in the universe.  If it wasn't there, the Universe would behave really, really differently because we can see the effect it has on the universe (gravitational lensing, or the effect of bending lights path through the universe with mass and the gravitational effect of Galaxies both spring to mind). 

Dark Energy, same applies.  Only instead of mass, it's seems to be a force that we don't understand that's feeding the expansion of the universe.  The expansion of the universe is accelerating, and without dark energy (simply an energy we don't understand the cause of) it should either be slowing down or retracting (in fact, it should still be expanding without dark energy, but slowing down).

3,,dunkybones,10/08/13,4,,4,"Dark matter/energy is going to be difficult to 'explain like I'm five' because even crazy smart astrophysicists don't know what it is, why it's there, or how it works. I think SecureThruObscure summed it up quite nicely.  
  
I would add that Dark Matter/Energy as a concept is there to fill in the math that otherwise doesn't work out. All the stars and planets and stuff in a galaxy? Sure there is plenty of it, but not enough for gravity to hold it all together, once you do the math. So there has to more matter we can't see or detect, let's call it dark matter.",no,view comment
4,,Gonions,10/08/13,7,,7,"When we observe how galaxies and the planets within them move around in space, their movement (and other information) allows us to come up with an estimate as to how much mass there is in that galaxy.

Unfortunately, many galaxies do not actually contain as much mass as we think they should. For this reason, we believe that space contains some kind of matter that we cannot observe directly, but whose effects we can measure in the form of he gravitational force they have on rotating galaxies. This matter is known as dark matter, and is called so because we cannot literally see it, like we can say another planet. 

Dark energy once again cannot be 'seen' so to speak, but its effects can be observed. For example, were it not for the existence of this energy, galaxies would not on the whole be accelerating away from each other (as we know they are).",no,view comment
5,,TalentedFool,10/08/13,3,,3,"Not a physicist, but this is how i always interpreted it:

The only radiation our eyes can see is visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum.  We know there are much more types of radiation beyond visible light because we have other senses.  But if we only use our eyes, we only see visible light.  We didn't discover how to understand other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum until we invented instruments and methods to detect it.

Similiarly, there is dark matter.  We know there is something there, because we can detect mass.  We can do a lot of things because we can detect mass, But none of our other senses or instruments we've made has ever been able anything detect anything else.  The reason scientists have trouble with it is because it's like we're trying to find a way to imagine a new color without it being a mix of any other known color.  the only thing we know about this new color, is that it exists.

It makes sense too I think.  I mean it would be pretty arrogant to assume that by total chance we just happened to evolve all the senses we needed to detect everything out there in the universe.",no,view comment

We see areas that behave as if there is a lot of matter, but we can not measure the matter itself. matter influences other matter by gravity and it bends space itself trough mass. these effects are better measurable on larger scales.

We assume that there is a lot of matter that does not interact with light out there (except for bending space through gravity/mass, which also bends paths of light and can lens light. If it does not interact with light it also never changes its temperature. We see a lot of light/heat in space and see the effects of a lot of mass.

18,,SirAnthos,11/08/13,1,,1,"Most of these answers are good but maybe some context?


So some astronomers were trying to calculate how much mass is in a certain galaxy. One possible way to do it was taking some ratios of mass, spin rate, and radius. There were other ways too, such as a ratio of luminosity and mass. They came to a startling conclusion. The galaxy was spinning too fast for the amount of light they can see. So they thought, there must be a lot of mass that isn't shining light. They called this Dark Matter.


There are many of candidates for dark matter at the moment. Someone posted something about WIMP. Those are massive neutral particles. There could be stars that are dead or extremely dim; like black holes, white dwarfs/neutron stars, or something called a brown dwarf. The last, and in my opinion most likely, a large expansive halo of cold hydrogen gas encompassing the galaxy. Though, even that has it's own problems, being that that's a lot of cold hydrogen gas. It could be all of those things.


I saw someone post about supermacro gravity might work differently than on solar system scale, and I think this could be bullocks, but who knows. There could be a factor of gravity that doesn't take over unless the scale is galactic clusters, and there is no dark matter.


As for dark energy, the universe is expanding. And its expanding faster and faster. Scientist think that something must be driving the acceleration of the expansion of the universe, and they call it dark energy until they get a more descriptive name for it.",no,view comment
19,,Victoria7474,11/08/13,1,,1,"The tools we use to measure the universe are like a big scale.  We SEE that the scale is holding a 4 lb weight, but the scale reads ""100 lbs.""  We don't know why.  Everywhere we look and every measurement we take has these 96 extra lbs we can't explain, see or directly measure, and yet we know quite accurately what the scale is going to say if we account for this extra weight in our equations and ideas on how things work.  But that doesn't change the fact that we still have no consistent explanation for what dark matter is- at all.  I think we call it 'Dark matter' for both reasons- we don't understand it AND we can't see it.  But ""dark"" is just a filler for ""unknown.""

21,,bla2bla1bla,11/08/13,,,0,"**Dark Matter**
To understand Dark Matter you have to know what normal matter is.
so anything you can see or touch is matter. and thing that has weight or ""mass"" is matter. some examples are : air, marbles, cats, dogs, stars, planets all that stuff.
As far as we can tell mater interacts with the magnetic spectrum OR regular light turn on a flash light and it reflects light back to your eye balls and you can see a what was once dark. all matter as we knew it interacted with some for of the magnetic spectrum, regular light or some form of radio waves or radiation.
Now Dark matter DOES NOT. lets say you had a box full of dark matter you could lift it up and it would be heavy, you could probably touch it too and maybe would feel like thick water (huge speculation right there) but you could not see it. flash a light on it and it will not reflect from it it would just pass right through it making it seem invisible. Not Black or dark (the absence of light) but invisible we could not see anything and the light would only reflect the bottom of the box. (another big speculation) so the truth is we have NO IDEA what dark matter is. all we know is 1. its heavy 2. we cant see it and can not interact with it in any way we normally would.
that's all for dark matter.

**Dark Energy**
*Dark energy is something else entirely and I wish we called it something else. we have to get in to astronomy. so we live on a planet that is in a solar system witch is in a local star cluster (a meh star cluster) in the Galaxy Milky way. there are other and as far as we know the universe gets big...really big. however we did not know if the universe was getting bigger or smaller or just hanging out at a set size. soon we found out about this stuff that is in us around us and all over everything, we cant see it, we can not interact with it, and it does not have any mass, so its got no weight. we starting to thing wtf is it doing? and its pushing ever so slightly on everything (in another spacial detentions is what a lot of people thing. by that I mean NOT up/down left/right forward/back, its pushing some other direction, yeah wrap your head around that bit lol sorry) this slight pressure or FORCE is gaining momentum and getting faster and slowly pushing EVERYTHING apart. now since we have only watched this for a short amount of time and its such a small force that we only just started to see its effects we do not know what it will eventually do or what part it plays in us as we are all a part of the same universe.
but some people do think it will push every everything apart so much so that eventually the elections will be pushed away from protons and matter its self will just be gone... I think that is ""the big chill"" type of the end of the universe. anyway that's dark energy for you, its just a weak little force that we hardly noticed at all but has a profound effect on reality

22,,hat_swap,11/08/13,1,,1,"So I am a condensed matter physicist and dark matter is very far removed from what I do. However, I can outline some basics and perhaps someone with a more proper background can provide a more detailed response for those interested. To begin, think back to when you would ride on a merry-go-round as a child. The faster it spins, the harder you have to hold on with your hands to keep from being flung off. The same goes for galaxies. That is to say, something has to hold on to the stars that make up these galaxies as they rotate about their center. The 'hands', in this case, that hold the stars in place is the net gravity of the galaxy. This gravity acts to pull everything into a common center. So you have a merry go round force pushing out and gravity pulling in. These conspire to cancel one another out and that, in a very small nutshell, is how galaxies both acquire and maintain their shape. This would be the end of the story, however when we carry out the actual calculations, we find that there is not enough mass to keep these galaxies from tearing themselves apart as they rotate!

To account for this discrepancy, it is postulated that these galaxies have mass that we cannot 'see'. Now, what does it mean to say we cannot see it? We mean something stronger than just that it does not emit, absorb, or reflect visible light. A more appropriate phrase would be that it does not interact strongly with regular matter. Of course this just begs the question, what does it mean to interact? And this is where the 4 fundamental forces of nature come into the story. Every (known) interaction that takes place between particles is done so via one of these four forces. So which ones would we expect dark matter to interact with? There is the strong force which bonds protons and neutrons into atomic nuclei (as the name implies, dark matter clearly should not interact with other matter via this force) so we can exclude it. Next, there is the electromagnetic force, which bonds atomic nuclei into molecules. As it turns out, on the proper length scale, this force is actually much stronger than the strong force. Moreover, this force is also responsible for generating light, so dark matter would clearly not be dark if it interacted with this force. This leave gravity and the weak force as the two remaining forces. The whole reason we postulate dark matter exists is to account for excess gravity, so clearly it must interact with this force. Thus, that leaves only the weak force (which, among other things, is responsible causing many types of particles to decay.) It is possible that dark matter does interact via both gravity and the weak force. However, because the weak force is so weak this means that it has nearly no effect on regular matter. Indeed, one of the leading theories of dark matter, WIMPS, which stands for weakly interacting massive particles, claims that this is the case . 

Of course there are many theories. Indeed, among the different other ideas as to what dark matter is, there exists another idea that dark matter does not exist at all. Instead, it is postulated that the equations of motion we use to calculate galactic rotation are not completely accurate (it would not be the first time this sort of thing has happened.) Specifically, it is Newton's equation Force = Mass * Acceleration that needs to be modified. This comes with its own acronym: MONDS, modified Newtonian dynamics. The idea is that F=M*A is correct when you have really big accelerations. However, for a massive galaxy, the amount of acceleration each star feels is actually very, very small. In this case, F=M*A is wrong; but just by a little bit. Not much at all really, but it does not take much to account for the mass discrepancy that we see. Scientists have actually worked out exactly what this modification would have to be and, when applied, they have found that it explains the mass discrepancy over a surprisingly wide array of different types of galaxies. I should stress that I am playing a bit of devils advocate here since MONDS is not well received in the scientific community (as far as I know), since it cannot explain other things that dark matter can, such as gravitational lensing in open space (ie: an odd bending of light that takes place in regions of space where no matter is visible.) Still, the idea of MONDS is instructive in the sense that it demonstrates that dark matter, what it is and what it is not, is still very much an open question.",no,view comment
