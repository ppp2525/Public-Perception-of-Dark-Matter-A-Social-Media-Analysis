3,,haplo_and_dogs,22/01/20,2516,,2516,"Probably not.   
For dark matter to be sitting in a clump at the center of a plaent or a star not only would it need to fall in, but it would then have to slow down.

Gravity is nearly perfectly restorative, meaning that all the gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy.  This means the dark matter would fall straight through the planet, never interacting, then pass out the other side.  

The dark matter, being unable to interact via em or the strong force has no way to get rid of this kinetic energy, so never slows down enough to remain bound to any system smaller than a galaxy.",no,view comment
4,,forte2718,22/01/20,201,,201,"Well, sort of.

Dark matter should indeed tend to be a little denser at massive bodies such as stars.  However, it would only be *very, very* slightly denser because it interacts so weakly with regular matter (and with itself), there is no possibility for ""accretion"" because nothing will slow it down when it reaches the center of a massive body.  If it comes in towards a massive body with almost any momentum at all, it will pass right through the body and then leave the body with roughly the same momentum.  It will do this over and over again, with its kinetic energy being exchanged for gravitational potential energy and then vice versa again, with nothing to damp these oscillations and no way to permanently lose that kinetic energy because there is no ""friction"" to slow it down and keep it there near the center of the star.  Ordinary matter only accretes into stars because it interacts electromagnetically, so it all ""bumps into"" itself at a star, slowing it down, converting the kinetic energy into thermal energy.

So, only the very slowest of dark matter particles should accumulate inside stars and other massive bodies.  And perhaps, if dark matter does interact very, very rarely and weakly, there *might* be a very slight friction helping dark matter to accrete a little bit.  But it can only be a very small amount.  We're talking like, the density of dark matter within a star would only be on the order of 1% denser than its density in interstellar space.  Not enough to make any significant difference on the scale of solar system dynamics.  It is only relevant for galaxies and larger structures like galaxy groups.

5,,[deleted],22/01/20,36,,36,"I don't know why no one else has brought up the fact that, depending on the particle, this is entirely possible and has been explored theoretically, including by at least one person I know personally.

Yes dark matter doesn't interact electromagnetically, however direct collisions with the nucleus of an atom can occur so long as the candidate particle interacts via the weak force. This is the basis of many dark matter detectors, collisions with atomic nuclei release energy as a photon and this can be detected if you're particularly clever (and guess the correct particle mass).  Admittedly, the only claimed detections of such particles that I know of were from the DAMA NaI detectors at LNGS and these are highly controversial.

I did some theoretical work for a similar project called SABRE, and as part of it attended a workshop in which this exact possibility was discussed with regards to the sun. I can't recall how it worked, this was several years ago now, but there was the possibility of using this to detect dark matter. It should be noted that even with high densities, due to the vast space between nuclei, these collisions are very rare, and the accretion is going to be slow. For something like the sun, we have relative velocities ranging from ~200-700m/s iirc so it's going to take a fair bit to slow down a particle enough to become trapped within a body like the sun.

It's very early in the morning down under, but when I hear back from my friend who worked on this I'll update this post.

Edit: friend got back to me, for 10GeV WIMPs capture rate is on the order of 1.8 tons per second from hydrogen, and around 6 tons per second from collisions with helium. Though I'd take those numbers with a grain of salt, they're very rough.

41,,[deleted],22/01/20,,,0,"What about atomic-scale gravitational interactions? 

Imagine you have a dark matter particle in orbit of the Earth. But instead of orbiting above the Earth's surface, a substantial portion of the orbit is below the Earth's surface.

As a whole, gravity would preserve the particle's orbit in a perfectly restorative fashion. It should neither gain nor lose velocity over the course of its orbit. 

However, what about atomic-scale gravitational effects? Everything is affected by gravity. Usually we ignore gravity in atomic-scale interactions because it is so much weaker than the other forces. However, for dark matter, gravity would actually be the dominant force, even at the atomic scale. An individual atom and a dark matter particle would exert an extremely small, but nonzero, gravitational force on each other. 

I'm imagining a atomic-scale version of dynamical friction. When passing through a massive body, a dark matter particle will occasionally pass extremely close to an atomic nucleus. The gravitational interaction between the nucleus and the dark matter particle would slightly change the velocity of the dark matter particle. Since the gravitational force between the two would be so small, each interaction would change the dark matter particle's velocity by only a tiny fraction of a percent. However, the number of interactions would be much larger than in classic dynamical friction. A dark matter particle might have many such interactions every orbit, while astronomical bodies have to wait eons between individual interactions. 

This type of gravitational, atomic-scale interaction would likely not be enough to capture a dark matter particle moving with escape velocity. However, if a dark matter particle were in orbit of a massive body, this effect could slowly erode its kinetic energy. This would have the effect of lowering its orbit, slowly causing them to clump in slow, tight ""orbits"" near the center of the body. 

Now, I have no idea what scale such interactions would work on. Depending on the specifics and the maths, this mechanism could take a few days to erode an orbit. Or, it could be so weak that a particle's orbit wouldn't be noticeably decayed before the heat death of the universe.",no,view comment

The large-scale behavior of dark matter is statistical and dynamical friction will tend to roughly average out across particles in general.  There is surely a very, very small effect (not unlike the tiny effect of gravitational radiation) but nowhere even remotely close to significant on cosmological scales.

In the end,  you're not really changing the total kinetic energy of all the bodies involved, so outside of dynamical friction between dark matter and baryonic matter which might result in one gaining kinetic energy and the other losing some, dark matter-dark matter dynamical friction will average out.

Right, those are the bulk properties I mentioned.  We can't measure them through EM forces because dark matter doesn't interact via EM.  Gravity is the only way we have to measure them.

>It's at least an outside possibility that dark matter could be interacting with itself in ways we couldn't even detect, isn't it?

Any significant additional interactions would have a noticable effect on its large-scale distribution, which is why we are confident that there are no additional significant interactions.  It is always possible that there are some very weak interactions such as the short-ranged weak force, and there are numerous experiments looking for weak-mediated annihilation signatures of dark matter for example, but none have been detected to date.

>That's part of my question, if aspects like those have even be theorized.

Yes, of course they have, astrophysicists aren't just sitting on their thumbs all day! :p  There is a ton of theoretical consideration based on many different models and those which make testable predictions generally have experiments either already completed, currently active, or planned for the future.

But some possibilities -- such as that of an additional interaction with a significant strength, like EM (normal or ""dark"") or the strong force -- are ruled out categorically.

Newton's law of gravitation ceases to be accurate at such small scales; you need to use general relativity, which has corrections to Newton's law.  And also, there are expected to be additional corrections at extremely small scales due to quantum effects, but we don't have a working theory of quantum gravity so we don't know what those corrections are.

>Wouldn't it interact then? Forming a very temporary black hole and then exploding in a tiny shower of Hawking Radiation?

Unless the total mass exceeds the Planck mass (unlikely for any pair of two elementary particles even with dark matter particles being very heavy) it would not be expected to form a black hole according to GR, and we don't actually know if it would even if those conditions are met because we don't have a working theory of quantum gravity.",no,view comment

Dark matter is observable. We see it. It could a thing. It seems to interact gravitationally, which means it has mass, which would imply it's a thing. But it doesn't seem to be very measurable.

We have exactly zero evidence of this.  We have evidence of gravitational interaction, and nothing else.  The question itself says ""If dark matter interacts with nothing besides gravity""

Would we have a greater density of dark matter at the center of the sun, absolutely, but it wouldn't be a blob, it would be transient flow.  I don't understand via what interaction the dark matter could use be captured by a source as small as a sun or planet.

Every dark matter detector looking for this has failed to detect any collisions.  We have no evidence that any force besides gravity mediates dark matter and normal matter.  Without a meditating force, there can be no collision. If you assume dark matter is super-symetric counterpoint, assume R-Parity and that you have a light stable particle, and that it does interact by the weak force you can say a lot about what it would do.  We have zero evidence for dark matter interacting via the weak force.

There is a massive assumption in your first listed paper.
""If DM consists of
WIMPs, they can be gravitationally captured by the Sun""

We have no evidence dark matter are WIMPs.  If they are then they have been experimetnally constrained to an incredibly small cross section and mass by experiments like Icecube and LUX. 

""The sun/planets are massive bodies that can slow down dark matter particles and trap them gravitationnaly. ""
I disagree this has been established to any degree.  There is no evidence of this.

Your attached article from the 80s is calculating assuming that dark matter are neutralinos, and assumes the higgs mass is less than 30GeV.

1. This is a very wrong assumption about the higgs mass.
2.  This assumes low energy super-symetry, which has been ruled out.

WIPS as dark matter is incredibly constrained by experiment.  If the question was ""If dark matter consists of WIMPs would it accumulate at the center of stars?"" then my answer would have been different.

The consensus is that dark matter is exactly what it is called:  matter, which is physical.  That is why dark matter is a part of the standard model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model (the ""CDM"" stands for ""cold dark matter"").

The truth is that we understand gravity exceptionally well across more than 30 orders of magnitude of experimentally-testable behavior, and every attempt to modify gravity to both account for dark matter and still explain all of the other observational evidence has met with failure -- and not for a lack of trying.  It is possible to modify the laws of gravity on large scales to fit *some* categories of observations, such as galaxies' rotation curves, but there are other categories of observations that modifying gravity seems to be completely incapable of explaining, such as the CMB power spectrum, gravitational lensing observations of collided galaxy clusters (which show a separation of the center-of-gravity and the center-of-baryonic-mass), rates of structure formation in the early universe, and more.  And to even fit things like galactic rotation curves, modified gravity models end up looking very ad hoc and finely-tuned, with different parameters for each galaxy that have to be fixed by observation and cannot be derived from first principles as a prediction, which is very unsatisfying.

Consequently, there is not a single model of modified gravity which is even viable.  Every model of modified gravity that has ever been proposed (and there have been quite a lot of them, studied in great detail) is demonstrably wrong.  Meanwhile, dark matter-based models are exceptionally simple (you literally just add dark matter with one parameter -- the mass density -- and that's it), and they fit *all* of the observations surprisingly well.

Here's a good example more or less explaining the status quo:  [Why the universe needs dark matter (and not MOND) in one graph](https://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/01/18/why-the-universe-needs-dark-matter-and-not-mond-in-one-graph).
