You might be using a figure of speech, in which case never mind. But if not, it's not the darkness itself making either invisible. It's that they don't reflect, absorb, or emit any kind of EM. Only two effects are currently observable:

* A gravitational pull, observable in how galaxies are held together and bend light - dark matter.

* An acceleration of the universe's rate of expansion - dark energy.

Alternatives to mainstream thoughts on dark matter and dark energy are still published in mainstream journals. There was even a recent paper shared in this very subreddit last week that argued that the expansion of the universe could be a, ""mirage"". 

The problems with papers like those, however, is that they simply do not agree with as many observations as the existing mainstream models. To use a different example: MOND has been dead in the water for years because it reliably cannot account for observations beyond spiral galaxy rotation rates without invoking dark matter. Yes, MOND papers still get published, but the vast majority focus on what little MOND does well instead of challenging it and coming up with modifications. 

I think you'd be hard pressed to find an actual paper that was withdrawn outside the context of it being improperly approved for publication or retracted by the authors themselves. I've seen some *terrible* garbage get through peer review over the years.",no,view comment

29,,SpleenBender,02/07/23,7,,7,"Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to make up a significant portion of the total matter content of the universe. It is called ""dark"" because it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, such as light, making it invisible and difficult to detect directly. Despite its elusive nature, its presence is inferred by its gravitational effects on visible matter and the structure of the universe.

The existence of dark matter was proposed to explain certain observations in astrophysics and cosmology that could not be accounted for by the known types of matter, such as stars, galaxies, and gas clouds. These observations include the rotational speeds of galaxies, the motion of galaxy clusters, and the distribution of matter in the universe on large scales.

One of the earliest pieces of evidence for dark matter came from observations of galaxy rotations. Based on the visible matter in galaxies, scientists expected the outer regions to rotate more slowly than the inner regions. However, observations showed that stars and gas in the outer regions were moving just as fast as those in the inner regions. This implied the presence of additional mass in the form of dark matter, providing the extra gravitational pull required to explain the observed rotational speeds.

Scientists have also studied the gravitational lensing effect, which occurs when the gravitational field of a massive object bends and distorts light passing near it. The observed lensing effects indicate the presence of more matter than can be accounted for by visible objects alone, suggesting the presence of dark matter.

The exact nature of dark matter remains unknown. It is often theorized to consist of non-baryonic particles, meaning they are not composed of protons and neutrons like ordinary matter. Various candidates for dark matter particles have been proposed, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions, but so far, none have been directly detected.

Efforts to detect dark matter particles are underway using a variety of methods, including underground detectors, particle accelerators, and astronomical observations. Scientists hope that by studying dark matter, they can gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe and its evolution.",no,view comment

As you say: There is a 'why'. And that 'why' gets the label until we know more precisely what that 'why' is and can give it a better label. That the long and short of it.

>Dark Matter at this time is not a thing, it is an observation only

Which is exactly what I said. We don't know. The effect is as if something matter-*like were to act.*  That's why we call it 'dark matter'. This does not imply in any way that it *has to be* some form of matter.
