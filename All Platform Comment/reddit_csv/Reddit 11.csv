2,,MorningStar_imangi,11/12/22,297,,297,"The gravity of unseen dark matter is the leading explanation for why galaxies rotate so fast, why galaxies orbit clusters so fast, why gravitational lenses so strongly deflect light, and why visible matter is distributed as it is both in the local universe and on the cosmic microwave background. The featured image from the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium Space Show Dark Universe highlights one example of how pervasive dark matter might haunt our universe. In this frame from a detailed computer simulation, complex filaments of dark matter, shown in black, are strewn about the universe like spider webs, while the relatively rare clumps of familiar baryonic matter are colored orange. These simulations are good statistical matches to astronomical observations.

Dark matter might be the answer, but we literally do not know that yet. There is no experiment that has detected dark matter.

153,,Malkiot,12/12/22,2,,2,"One candidate for dark matter are primordial black holes. In the case of PBHs the EM radiation simply wouldn't be able to leave it's schwarzschildradius hence making it ""dark"" to our observations.

>Since it has never been observed except by its gravity, it does seem most likely that dark matter has no direct or even indirect connection to the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions in particle theory, including the extensions thereof aimed at ameliorating problems with naturalness existing therein with respect to the Higgs boson and the strong CP problem.

>The three clues we mentioned in the Introduction, i.e., the dominance of black holes in the entropy inventory, the CMB spectrum and the holographic entropy maximum all hint at PBHs as the dark matter constituents.

>One ambiguity is whether the maximum entropy limit suggested by holography should be saturated, in which case the mass function for the PEMBHs must be extended to high values.

 >In physical cosmology, the Big Rip is a hypothetical cosmological model concerning the ultimate fate of the universe, in which the matter of the universe, from stars and galaxies to atoms and subatomic particles, and even spacetime itself, is progressively torn apart by the expansion of the universe at a certain time in the future, until distances between particles will become infinite. According to the standard model of cosmology, the scale factor of the universe is accelerating, and, in the future era of cosmological constant dominance, will increase exponentially.

But because space is so unimaginably vast, the odds that we’d encounter one that detect through conventional means could still be astronomically low. 

That said, even a primordial black hole on the order of micrometers would still pack as much matter as Mt Everest, so if was next to you, yes, you would notice it. You might not see it, but that change in local gravity would definitely be noticeable.",no,view comment

178,,TotallyRealDev,12/12/22,3,,3,"So from my understanding (Which almost definetly is wrong) is that there are two real possibilites.

A) The Universe is a infinate 'flat' plane that goes on forever

B) Is 'curved' and it would be like traversing around the surface of a sphere.

Currently we have no way of knowing but our limited measurments lean closer to a flat plane than curved space time.

The next thing to consider is that what are currently seeing around us is but an infinitesimal small snippit of the universe as a whole. That's why we always refere to it as the observable universe.

Now when we are viewing the edge of the universe we are also looking back in time. If you were to somehow instantly teleport to the furthest possible point that we could see then you would be in a sense also time traveling 14.5 billion years.

With our current understanding of physics we predict that things would look more or less the same as they do here in our local cluster. It then wouldn't be too much of a strech to assume that things would look the same beyond that barrier that is the observable universe.

Also things start to get really weird when it comes to causality and multi-billion lightyears of seperating.
