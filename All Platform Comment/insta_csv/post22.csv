12,,gerxld_27,,6976413421,"2020-10-10 10:29:17",0,"@freezybreezy123 basically dark matter is composed of particles that do not absorb, reflect, or emit light, so they cannot be detected by observing electromagnetic radiation like visible light or radio waves. This in simple terms means dark matter is very hard to detect and is very weak when it intersects with normal matter as it is made theoretically of WIMPS which are heavier than protons. But the earth is so far from where dark matter is emitted so little of it actually meets us so it doesn’t affect us. But if there was a lot then we would be exposed to EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS OF RADIOACTIVITY",17895419923623079,https://www.instagram.com/gerxld_27/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CGJ72EuD2Ql/c/17895419923623079
