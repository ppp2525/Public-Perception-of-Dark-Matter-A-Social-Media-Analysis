The idea that we are made in the image of some imaginary deity is ludicrous. In my opinion, just accepting the beliefs of ignorant men who lived thousands of years ago is silly. I will never do that. The only way to understand reality is through evidence and rational thought tempered by humility and kindness.",view comment
