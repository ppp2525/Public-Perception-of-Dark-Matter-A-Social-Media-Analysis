27,,forgeardchris,,59205088223,"2023-05-25 18:47:38",0,"Dark matter doesn’t interact with normal matter as it’s higher dimensional matter, ie in more than 3 spacial dimensions.

Gravity is also higher dimensional, or it’s true nature exists in higher dimensions and what we feel is a shadow of that higher dimension, it’s why gravity is so weak and dark matter can have mass and a gravitational force associated with it.

In summary;
Dark matter is a higher dimensional matter, so does not interact.

All has the property mass, gravity is associated with mass, so dark matter can exert forces on our 3 space matter.

Gravity is not confined to our 3 spacial dimensions, it “leaks” into this world, we experience the “shadow” of it.

In a sense when we see a foam on largest scales, where the stars and galaxies typically form along these “highways” 😉 of which is a “shadow” of this higher dimensional space.

And it pervades all, from large scale to small scale in the form of a foam.
It is a clue… 😉 

Gravity, much like light, produces physical limits of this universe… 😉

There is a reason gravity doesn’t play ball… it’s not originating from here… 😉",17888342672783519,https://www.instagram.com/forgeardchris/,https://www.instagram.com/p/Csq_mmfNEI_/c/17888342672783519

I’m not saying we’re not amazingly close (hopefully) but if you physically  have engineered something, you know things are missed, and that’s here in reach of our hands. We also know to a degree that our own brains 🧠 make up stuff when collecting data.  Again and again and again I say…. What an amazing place. I like the fact that the universe works in and with a set of laws and it doesn’t matter who you are , size matters. I think when some ponder their observations of the universe they forget we only see a small spectrum of light, which is an energy field, which temperature is also an energy field.

For instance, since they make up 5x the mass of the universe compared to regular matter, we should see things like black hole mergers, large (think neutron star) object falling in and stuff like that, all of which give out loads of radiation. The only way we wouldn't detect them is if they are numerous and small, which is the idea behind primordial black holes. These resolve some of the issues around gravitational lensing and the like, but the fact that we can neither detect their existence or their deaths through hawking radiation places hard upper and lower boundaries on their sizes.
