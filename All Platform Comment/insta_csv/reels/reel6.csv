If you have a deformed circle you see that it is deformed in the 2nd-dimension, so in what dimension or dimensions would the mirror universe be deformed?? If it is a mirror universe some would take that to mean that every particle and object in this universe would be represented in the mirror universe but in a reversed CPT but maybe that is not so, maybe the mirroring occurs only on the fundamental level meaning every particle here has a mirror counterpart in the mirror universe but that only in the fundamental scale meaning there would be equal numbers of particles in both universes but with reversed CPT but that need not mean that the macroscopic agglomerations of particles are mirrored as well?? Meaning their galaxies may not be in the same location as their mirror galaxies here, leading us to observe that some of our galaxies have no dark matter??",18052335298588778,https://www.instagram.com/websurfer352/,https://www.instagram.com/p/C4lhoFwvvy0/c/18052335298588778

Virtual pairs are always exactly mirrored, but those are fundamental particles at the fundamental level, it may differ in the macroscopic level?? Is that what they mean by deformed??",17920313180860156,https://www.instagram.com/websurfer352/,https://www.instagram.com/p/C4lhoFwvvy0/c/17920313180860156
