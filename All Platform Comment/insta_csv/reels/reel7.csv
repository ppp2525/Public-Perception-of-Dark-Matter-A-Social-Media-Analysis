The word theory is something that describes WHY something happens (big bang theory explaining why of the expansion, relativity theory explaining why gravity), as opposed to LAW which is something that describes HOW something happens (Newton's gravitational law only described how gravity happens under some limitations, not why there is gravity). So in science the world THEORY still referees to something that has been proven multiple times. It is NOT something that has no proof.",view comment

Dark matter is a concept that has not been proven, which could explain why our equations don't work with spinning galaxy. To be simple, galaxies need a specific mass in order to be stable, but our equations say that they're only 20% of what they should be. Some people say our equations don't work on galaxies, and others say our equations works, but we need to add something we don't know it exists to make them works",view comment

Could this be where objects pulled by black holes end up and if it makes 80% of the universe could we be orbiting it as a universe.",view comment

Therefore we are in a slower or faster time field than dark matter. Just as we cannot physically see the past or future we cannot see dark matter but understand it is there.",view comment
