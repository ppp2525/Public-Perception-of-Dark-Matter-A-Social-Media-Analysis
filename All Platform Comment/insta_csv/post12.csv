What is known as 'dark-matter' may very well just be nothing and the excess gravity we detect may be the result of some unknown phenomena regarding how matter behaves in a particular organization (gravity producing unknown traits/behaviours of the fundamental units of nature) - i.e. some unknown but fundamental traits and behaviour regarding the very basic units of nature that is interpreted as the excess gravity at such large scales!!",17867603123219536,https://www.instagram.com/_sourav.suman_/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ3hfI9L0ha/c/17867603123219536
