Sure things can hang the ying to their yang but not everything has a polar opposite. Things such as the entire universe, it does not have an opposite to itself (sure string theory suggest more universes than itself but that doesn’t mean it’s opposite). Another example is anti-matter. When exposed to normal matter it destroys itself and releases all the energy hat the two particles once had (in the form of heat, sound and photons). Anti matter cannot coexist with normal matter, don’t forget these are actual polar opposites to each other. Nothing is actual directly related to each other until you look at the quantum level. It just seems that way.
