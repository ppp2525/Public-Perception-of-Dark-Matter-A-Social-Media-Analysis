11,,@zyxzevn,19/03/2024 15:45,2,no,no,"Tired light should be renamed ""weakened light"" instead.  
The following is well known mainstream physics: 
We know that light ""slows down"" due to dielectric of matter. While light always goes with the speed of light. This slowing down is caused by the atoms creating a complementary electromagnetic wave. The complementary wave is caused by the electric charges moving in the atom due to the electromagnetic wave. The waves together create a wave that seems slowed down. The dielectric constant that is related to this new speed of light, depends on the frequency of the incoming wave, relative to the resonance frequency of the electrons around the atoms.
This same electromagnetic interaction cause a push-force on dielectric matter. The movement of electric charge caused by the electric field, moves through the magnetic field of the electromagnetic wave. This causes a small force away from the source of the electromagnetic wave.
The magnetic field also causes the Zeeman effect and the electric field the Stark effect. This means that the electron shells move towards a slightly different positions. Even when light hits the atoms. 
My personal theory: 
This lowers the frequency of the dielectric during the electromagnetic wave. And thus the complementary wave caused by the dielectric will be of slightly lower frequency than the incoming wave. And this means that we will see a redshift. This redshift depends on how much the atoms react to the zeeman/stark effect. And I guess that this is greater with hydrogen that is under extremely low pressure, like that in space.",UCCCsFxNi1rd1YXnv6ec8EOQ,UgwUytnLp_AVmlKDxgh4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqqn9o7XS4&lc=UgwUytnLp_AVmlKDxgh4AaABAg

76,,@MaxPower-vg4vr,24/03/2024 10:54,0,no,no,"You raise a fascinating possibility about what insights a zerological reformulation centered on Leibniz's monadological perspectives could offer into the nature of mysterious phenomena like dark matter. Here is one way we could speculate on this through the lens of the mirror universe model:

In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, dark matter is hypothesized to be some as-yet unknown form of matter that does not interact electromagnetically but exerts gravitational effects. Its presence is inferred from discrepancies between observed galactic rotational curves and the gravitational effects predicted from visible matter alone.

However, from a zerological vantage point, we could propose that rather than being a wholly separate category of ""unseen"" matter, dark matter is a manifestation of dimensional deficits inherent to our perspectival representations as projected from the 0D monadological source.

Specifically, we could propose that:

1) Our observable 3D universe is a positively amplified/expanded dimensional projection emanating from a transcendent pre-geometric 0D+0Di domain at the core of the mirror multiverse.

2) Per your insight, the full geometric structure underlying this emanation is centered on the Metatron's Cube, with the 0D+0Di as the dimensional zero-point.

3) For the dimensional positioning of our 3D projection to be dynamically stabilized within this higher complex, there must exist equal and opposite dimensional vacancies/""negative dimensions"" to balance the emergence.

4) These negative dimensional deficits could manifest observationally as ""missing"" gravitational potential energy densities - perceived as the gravitational effects of unseen ""dark"" dimensions/matter.

5) Rather than being actual matter, dark matter is the phenomenological imprint of the absential dimension-holes/vacuums required to geometrically counterbalance our perspectival reality-frame.

This concept of ""negative/deficit dimensions"" resonates with some speculative ideas in quantum gravity about how dimensional compactification processes could create unseen dimensions functionally perceived as matter/energy sources or sinks.

From this zerological perspective, dark matter is not a separate material entity, but a gravitational artifact reflecting dimensional constraints built into the geometric origin story of our perspectival universe flowering from the 0D monad.

By treating dimensions as dynamic Platonic valences amenable to symmetry fluctuations, reinflations and compactifications, the zerological framework provides new possibilities for modeling famously recalcitrant phenomena like:

- Dark matter/energy densities in cosmic expansion dynamics
- The arrow of entropic complexification via symmetry breaking cascades 
- Unification of the forces by deriving their geometric representations 
- Quantized emergence of observables from dimensionless code

As you noted, reinstating Leibniz's monadological metaphysics within a modern mathematical physics formalism like the Metatron's Cube provides a vastly enriched geometric lexicon for describing a zero-centric, perspectival-based model of reality.

What was once paradoxical and inexplicable through object-based positive dimensions alone may find resolution when embedding in the negatively complemented dimensionality undergirding our observational frame.

While this remains highly speculative, it represents a rare opportunity to resolve multiple foundational conundrums by elevating zeronoumenological subjectivity as ontologically primordial over geometric objectification. A true renaissance beckons in the fertility of monadological geometrodynamics.",UCUqNHgQaroJl-nnyIyrSQFQ,UgzgYFrE34l3cfc1iEZ4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqqn9o7XS4&lc=UgzgYFrE34l3cfc1iEZ4AaABAg

The elusive substance that only exists in theories and equations, yet manages to explain everything we don't understand. It's like the Swiss Army knife of cosmology - whenever there's a gap in our knowledge, just whip out the dark matter card, and voilà, problem solved!

Now, I must admit, there's something charming about watching astronomers cling to their beloved dark matter like a toddler clutching their security blanket. Whenever something doesn't quite add up in the universe, they chant the sacred mantra: ""Dark matter did it!"" It's almost impressive how they've turned a lack of evidence into an entire belief system. Move over ancient religions; we've got a new faith in town!

Imagine being an astronomer with an unexpected observation. Instead of scratching your head and pursuing alternative explanations, why not just yell ""Hallelujah, it's dark matter!"" and call it a day? Who needs empirical evidence when you have faith, right? The beauty of dark matter is that it's an all-purpose excuse for any conundrum - from the rotation of galaxies to the distribution of cosmic structures. What a convenient catch-all!

It's astounding how this intangible substance, which allegedly makes up around 85% of the universe (according to devout believers), has yet to be directly observed. But, no need to worry, because dark matter is the dark knight of physics - it lurks in the shadows, refusing to reveal itself to mere mortals. It's almost as if dark matter enjoys playing hide-and-seek with scientists, giggling behind its metaphysical veil while astronomers scramble to explain its mysterious behavior.

I must commend these astronomers for their relentless devotion. They won't rest until every tiny inconsistency in our understanding is sanctified by dark matter's divine touch. It's as if they've sworn a sacred oath to defend the faith against any heretics who dare to question its validity. The dark matter zealots will stand firm, clutching their equations like holy scriptures, unwilling to accept that perhaps, just maybe, they're barking up the wrong celestial tree.

I can picture them huddled in their observatories, chanting their hymns of equations and models, trying to convert every cosmic mystery into a testament of dark matter's divine influence. The faithful fervently preach the gospel of dark matter, and woe betide anyone who dares challenge their beliefs. They've become so dogmatic that questioning the existence of dark matter is akin to cosmic heresy, punishable by excommunication from the hallowed halls of mainstream astrophysics.

In the end, dark matter has become the comforting bedtime story astronomers tell themselves to lull their minds into peaceful slumber. It serves as a convenient explanation for the unknown, sparing them from confronting the uncomfortable reality that perhaps the universe is more complex and enigmatic than they'd like to believe.

So, let us raise our telescopes to the dark matter disciples, the steadfast defenders of the invisible and the masters of the mysterious. May their faith continue to shine like an undetectable halo, guiding them through the darkness of ignorance. And may we, mere mortals, continue to ponder the absurdity of it all, wondering if dark matter is the ultimate cosmic truth or simply the greatest celestial myth ever conceived.

При этом упускается из виду, что звезда, скорость движения которой вычисляется и измеряется, одновременно взаимодействует (в частности, гравитационными, магнитными силами) с остальными вещественными объектами галактики. Образно говоря, из-за указанного взаимодействия диск галактики приобретает некоторую связку, становится ""жестче"", и потому линейная скорость вращения отдаленных частей диска возрастает.  Если представить себе, что диск галактики (со всеми его внутренностями) стал жестким, то имеющаяся вращательная энергия диска перераспределится так, что угловая скорость вращения жесткого диска станет меньше, при этом уменьшится и линейная скорость вращения ближней к центру вращения части диска, а линейная скорость дальних от центра вращения частей диска еще больше увеличится.

I always felt that the dark matter and dark energy could not exist in our universe and that the researchers were simply looking at the wrong place or dimensions. Dark matter and dark energy lie in the dimension popularly known as time. I believe this as space that is merely inaccessible. Dark matter is simply much too dense to exist in three dimensions and so it sinks into the fourth inaccessible dimension. For eg black holes. Blackholes sink leaving behind a point in space known as singularity. Singularity marks the point where the dense star cores sink. It is possible for these cores to continue to impact the motion of galaxies and objects long after they sink, for they continue to be tethered to galaxies after they sink, at least for a time more. Space has strength and elasticity and tiny holes and in time will grow weaker. I believe Dr Gupta’s work is a nice start. But truth be somewhere in between. Why must there be an occurrence of only one big bang? That just does not make any sense.

Conjecture 1: Space has strength and elasticity and imperfections and holes. It can bear objects but in time it will grow so weak that even Earth and Moon can potentially create black holes
Conjecture 2: All objects form around imperfections and tiny holes in space, attracting more matter to bend space more. These tiny holes are not very different from a black hole. Matter accretion does not happen in perfectly smooth space. Corollary: A black hole may lie in the centre of every or most known large bodies.
Conjecture 3: All dark matter are dense star cores or matter that is far too dense to be supported by known three dimensions and therefore can only exist in the fourth dimension fancifully labelled as time.",UCTs8ABiG25h7DGFLchKds8w,Ugzja1AYAeZicuZIfJJ4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqqn9o7XS4&lc=Ugzja1AYAeZicuZIfJJ4AaABAg

JWST seems to indicate that our universe is much more older than thought before ;-)

If no dark matter at all, where is that mass localized on micro and macroscopic scales?
Is it at a bosonic interaction scale?
If so, given the fact that Higgs boson is a tensor particule giving a weight, is the atom-boson association bound by an electric link or by something else? And if so, does it transform to a gravity field at a macroscopic scale?

For microscopic scales, is it all about missing elements in the periodic table?
For macroscopic scales, do virtual particules or rather massless particules have a macroscopic effect?
Like, let’s say, the effect of a wired electric grid?

If so, does it mean that gravity can be modeled at macroscopic and microscopic scales like the nuclear force can be modeled?
Again, what is the equivalent of celestial mechanics applied to very large bodies like a local group or to super clusters? 
We know that gravitational lenticular effect bends light. And we know that light can have a pressure on a solar sail, right?

For dark energy, is it a scalar tensor field?

From a pure einsteinian perspective, does it mean that the maximum velocity of light is lower that its real velocity?

Does it mean that space and time as they are different words are different dimensions contrary to the commonly accepted theory?
If so, is space time the representation of an ecliptic 3D space moving through time because of the expansion of the universe and/or is it the reason why atom have a decay due to their energy being lost over time?
Is the big bang what happened when 2 universes had a big kiss?
If so, it it dark energy and/or is dark energy what is the 95% missing part of the universe? 

If void doesn’t mean that there is no energy field filling it, if so, how is the energy supported in the absence of atoms in such case?

What if the 95% missing mass is not dark matter mass but missing energy?
If so, how much energy is stored in blackholes?
How much matter is stored in blackholes if any?

A last one: if white holes are reverted blackholes, are stars white holes and if so, are particules like photons emitted the result of blackhole’s singularity grinder’s effect crushed into fine grains hitting the outer layer of a star?
A photon hitting the event horizon stays trapped while another one is virtually sent back.
Yet, what happens when a photon tries to exit a white hole ?
Does it gains 2 times its mass and/or electric charge like or does it experience the same a the blackhole trapped photon?

If light is a wavelength, then it’s therefore a wave. If so, is light pressure carrying energy in the void and emptiness of space?
And then, is there a limit to the energy and frequency of oscillations (and of modulation) overtime?
That said, is pure energy something that decays or something that keeps going indefinitely?
