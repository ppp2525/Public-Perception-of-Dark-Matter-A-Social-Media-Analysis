3,,@esecallum,02/03/24 21:43:07,1,no,no,"Ah, the audacious astronomers, those celestial maestros who, in their cosmic symphony, have now composed a sonata of avoidance for the electric and plasma models of the universe. Their fear of these alternatives has grown so profound that they've resorted to verbal contortions, performing linguistic ballets to divert attention from the cosmic outcast – plasma.

Enter the grand illusion: once-humble plasma filaments, those wisps of ionized matter, have now ascended to the lofty title of ""objects."" Yes, you heard it right – objects. Because, naturally, uttering the P-word might provoke a cosmic uprising, shaking the very foundations of astronomical dogma.

It's as if astronomers are participants in a cosmic charades game, tactfully replacing ""plasma"" with the ambiguous ""objects,"" hoping that the cosmic audience won't catch on. ""Look over here at these mysterious objects,"" they declare, with a conspiratorial wink, trying desperately to divert attention from the heretical idea that perhaps, just perhaps, electricity plays a starring role in the cosmic drama.

But why the cosmic shyness, esteemed astronomers? Is it the terror of challenging established doctrines, the apprehension of acknowledging that the universe might be a bit more electrically charged than the textbooks dictate? Or is it simply easier to conjure cosmic charlatanry, renaming plasma currents as elusive ""objects"" and hoping no one will notice?

And now, a cosmic twist in this grand performance: astronomers, driven by an apparent disdain for scientific credibility, have birthed a menagerie of mythical entities from the cosmic void – dark photons, dark ions, dark sectors, and dark voids. It's as if they're pulling these cosmic rabbits out of a hat, or perhaps from a location less glamorous.

In this cosmic masquerade, astronomers, once heralded as seekers of truth, now perform linguistic acrobatics to sidestep inconvenient words. It's like discussing the solar system without whispering the word ""Sun,"" an act of linguistic gymnastics that distorts the very essence of scientific inquiry.

So here's a cosmic encore for these linguistic illusionists, seamlessly conjuring ""dark"" entities from the cosmic shadows. The theater of astronomy may be dimming, but the spectacle of linguistic escapades continues, skillfully performed under the watchful eyes of the old guard. Bravo, for turning the pursuit of knowledge into a cosmic vaudeville act, complete with dark photons and fantastical wordplay.",view comment

Maybe instead of trying to detect dark matter it’s self maybe we should look for the gravitational effect instead in a empty part of space. I don’t know if this would work.

Our tools are extensions of our senses allowing us to see or experience things we couldn’t see or experience before.

I think it’s too soon to say one thing or another is “absurd”. I haven’t seen anything that refutes dark matter to a very high degree and also offers an alternative explanation. Of course, I’ve not seen anything that convinces me that dark matter does exist. We will evolve experiments that will lead us one way or another.

As an aerospace engineer, that really annoys me. And I think our cousins in the Science part of STEM have really lost the way when it comes to the scientific method.

We try explaining it with spooky matter, we try explaining it with new wacky physics.... 

Why haven't we tried explaining it with ""maybe the measurement method is flawed""

Where is the ""what we are seeing is distorted"" option.

We have never, in our history  observed the universe from outside the sphere of influence of our solar system.

If one looked through frosted glass all of our life and decided how the world works via that cloudy view, we would be ridiculously off the mark of reality...

How many of these hail mary super ridiculous theories would fall apart if we just took the simplest explanation... ""we are wrong about how light works / travels"".

In engineering we are willing to admit the bare basics could be radically different based on enviroment all the time...

What's the problem with saying that maybe, just maybe, the galaxies ""spinning too fast"" out there are actually spinning normally, but there is just some optical illusion with how light travels from there to here that distorts in just the right way to make it look like its spinning faster? 

We base all our wacky observations on assuming we know how light works 100%, but yet we've had dozens of ""this doesn't make sense assuming what we are seeing is right"" moments that'd all be more easily explainable if light itself was the culprit of the weird observations... it honestly baffles me how barely anyone in academia and science questions it ??",view comment
