However matter with the assistance of explosive propulsion could leave this time dimension which is exactly what I believe dark matter is, matter that was expelled in an explosion, maybe the Big Bang, beyond the speed of time/light. This matter still exist, you can detect it, you just cant see it.

The same counts for the big bang theory. The big bang (if it happened) did not create the whole universal system. It was discovered that our universe is actually colliding with another.

It is pointless to care for ancient Egyptians or the big bang theory. We must intensify our search and must finally understand that civilizations existed before and completely vanished from this planet. Göbeklitepe and Karahantepe showed this truth.

36,,@TomHendricksMusea,20/03/24 17:39:36,1,no,no,"The Curvature of Space May Be Caused by Anti Gravity, Not Gravity.

The curvature of space is now defined as this: Massive bodies, like planets, have gravitational fields around them that causes light or any matter to travel in curved paths around them.
My suggestion is that the expanding space caused by dark energy, an anti gravity like force, causes light or matter to travel in curved paths around massive bodies.

Therefore it's not gravity causing curved space, but the anti gravity force, dark energy causing curved space.

The expanding force of dark energy is 70% of the universe and by far the greatest force in the universe.  It pushes and expands everywhere in space.  But it is weakest where there is massive bodies; because, there is no empty space there to push back from!
The dark energy drops off significantly near massive bodies. This dark energy pushes or expands from all sides. But there is little dark energy pushing back between the planet and a passing photon, or matter of any kind. That's where dark energy is the weakest.

Therefore any photons or matter of any kind that is nearing a planet are pushed by dark energy toward the planet.

They are pushed toward it from empty space, not pulled toward it because of gravity.

The expanding force of dark energy between any planet and a photon is weak and weaker the closer the two objects are to each other. This is the opposite of gravity.

See drawing.  When the photon traveling from left to right approaches the planet, dark energy striking the planet from all sides is much greater than the weak amount of dark energy between the photon and planet.  This causes the photon to be pushed toward the planet in a curved path.

This helps explains an alternate reason for the curvature of space. This suggests curvature of space is caused by dark energy.",view comment
37,,@TomHendricksMusea,20/03/24 17:39:53,0,no,no,"Dust in the Wind, a 2nd Look at the Universe
 (5% dust, 95% wind)

When we look at the universe, we find that all of the matter, gravity and charge is little more than a smidgen of dust in the wind of a massive storm of dark energy and dark matter from empty space. Further that charge, matter, and gravity have little affect on 95% of the universe.

First let's reexamine the contents of the universe:

Dark Energy 70% . Theoretical force that behaves the opposite of gravity by expanding empty space.

Dark Matter 25%.   The so called dark matter is 85% of all matter, but it's not there. Supposedly it's found in the empty space halos around galaxies and  galaxy clusters.  But though dark MATTER can't be found in empty space, Dark ENERGY can be. That is the known force of expansion from empty space. My suggestion is that dark matter and dark energy are the same.

Free hydrogen and helium 4%.  This is 98% of all mass in the visible universe.

Stars 0.5%. Mostly concentrated hydrogen and helium burning in stars.

Neutrinos 0.3%  Virtually massless with no electrical charge.

Heavy Elements 0.03%. Dust in the wind compared to the rest.
This is what everything in planets is made of, including us.

So let's consider what this information means. It suggest that Dark Energy and Dark Matter make up 70% + 25%; or 95% of everything there is.  What's important is that this 95% does not contain: charge, gravity, or matter.

The rest or the 5% is mostly dust in the wind compared to the massive dark forces. Further we find that  of this 5%, most of it is hydrogen or helium, or neutrinos.  So the actual part of the universe that we think of as having charge, gravity, and matter and is so important in physics is very very very very very very small and insignificant in comparison.

Sum up.  First the Universe is mostly a neutral void that is expanding from empty space.
Next 95% of the universe has nothing to do with charge, matter, or the force of gravity.

Physicists, for 100 years have concentrated on the dust in the wind and missed the real universe. They have concentrated  on charge when 95% of the universe does not have charge, they've concentrated on matter when 95% of the universe does not have matter, and they have concentrated on the force called gravity between the specs of dust, when 95% of the universe has, not gravity but an antigravity force of Dark Energy and Dark Matter.

38,,@TomHendricksMusea,20/03/24 17:40:10,0,no,no,"My Model For The First Events in the Beginning of the Universe. 
(From left to right) 

1. Singularity before the Big Bang was eternal photons.
2. Big Bang was a release of photon energy.
3. Photons through pair conversion, created space time; and both the fundamental particles and first atoms of hydrogen and helium.
4. The universe temperature continued to drop until the annihilation phase when all free electrons (e-) and positrons (e+) not in atoms, began to annihilate and turn into pure energy.
5. This massive universe wide conversion of mass to energy caused the inflation phase.

This model suggests my answers to these physics questions.

Q. What was the singularity that started the Big Bang?
A. Eternal photons outside of space and time.

Q. Where did the anti matter go?
A. It went into the protons and neutrons.  Protons have 2 positrons and one electron.  Neutrons have 1 proton and one electron.

Q. Why did inflation happen?
A. When the temperature fell low enough, free electrons and positrons annihilated in a universal wide explosion of energy that created the inflation period.

***
The Big Bang singularity produced a zoo of waves. So which ones lasted?
Most compatible waves formed atoms, molecules, etc (or the most neutral didn't react with anything) while the rest decayed.

That is important clues to every aspect of physics. That is a physics natural selection.

Bunyaviruses are a family of RNA viruses that are primarily transmitted to humans and other animals by arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, and flies, or by rodents. The Bunyaviridae family includes several genera, with notable viruses such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Hantavirus, and Rift Valley fever virus.
The Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) is a notable member of the Bunyaviridae family. It was first isolated in 1943 from mosquitoes in the Bunyamwera area of Uganda. Bunyamwera virus primarily infects birds but can also cause mild infections in humans. Human infections with Bunyamwera virus are generally mild and can cause symptoms such as fever, headache, joint pain, and rash.
Another notable bunyavirus is the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which primarily affects domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels but can also infect humans. Rift Valley fever can cause severe disease in both animals and humans, including fever, muscle pain, headache, and in severe cases, hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis. RVFV is primarily transmitted to humans through contact with infected animal tissues or through mosquito bites.

Bunya viruses are a group of arboviruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae family. They are named after the Bunyamwera district in Uganda, where the prototype virus was first isolated. Bunyaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, and they are primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of infected arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, and sandflies.
There are several viruses within the Bunyaviridae family that are known to cause diseases in humans, including:
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV): This virus causes Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a severe illness characterized by fever, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding. It is found in Africa, Asia, and parts of Europe.

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV): RVFV can cause Rift Valley fever, a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans. In humans, it can cause flu-like symptoms, hepatitis, and in severe cases, hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis. It is found in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.
Hantaviruses: Some hantaviruses, such as Sin Nombre virus in North America and Hantaan virus in Asia, belong to the Bunyaviridae family. These viruses can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), respectively.

Bunyaviruses are considered significant pathogens due to their ability to cause severe diseases in humans and animals. Prevention of bunyavirus infections primarily involves vector control measures, such as insecticide spraying to control mosquito populations, and avoiding contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids. Additionally, in the case of certain bunyaviruses like Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, there is ongoing research into vaccine development and antiviral treatments.

Overall, Bunyaviruses pose significant public health concerns due to their potential to cause disease outbreaks in both animals and humans. Efforts in surveillance, prevention, and control of bunyavirus infections are important for mitigating their impact on public health.",view comment

This is the most hilarious theory that is still taken for a fact today.

2 protons collisions as nothing to do with this theory.
The Big Bang theory is about the creation of quantum particles.
Nothing to do with CERN experiments and the explosion of particles.

Relativity say that: And the truth is:
Empty space do not exist. 
If you have space, you have something in it.

Photon are not creating space.
Electron do create some space but, single electron is not creating much. 
A fraction of the space created by an helium particles.

All the space that we live in is mainly created by our black hole.
A fraction of the space that we live in is also created by our sun and our planet.

The Big Bang is a joke, but not that much. It's also very close to the truth.
Expansion of the universe is also a joke, but also real.

Electron, proton, neutron are created every day.
Today we still say that everything was created in a single day (Big Bang, God etc.)
And with the creation of atoms, came the expansion of space.
The universe is expanding a bit more every day.

Relativity and quantum physics works perfectly with each other if you take into account the size of the space.",view comment

Very informative and interesting.
Best thing is : 
DW does not trick viewers into clicking a story and later compelling readers / viewers to pay for full content.
That's what many greedy media companies are doing.",view comment
