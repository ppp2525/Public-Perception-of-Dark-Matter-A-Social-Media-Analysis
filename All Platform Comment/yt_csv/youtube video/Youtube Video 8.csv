I know this may not sit well with physicists but I would like to present a very limited understanding of Buddhist cosmology because this presentation takes into account both the physical realms of the universe and non-physical realms of consciousness and may shed some inkling of insight into the ""matter."" Please not that this description was given over 2,500 years ago to an audience in which  telescopes were not available...

Just as there are multiple planes or levels of consciousness that we can experience correspondingly, according to Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple planes or dimensions in which consciousness can reside. Ths most subtle being the ""Formless realm"" where, as the name implies, there is no physical form yet consciousness resides. This is followed by the ""Form realm"", which does contain a subtle physical form, and then the ""desire realm"" where we are. To add to the complexity of this, there are multiple planes of existence within each of these realms in which beings, whose number, like the universe, is infinite, reside according to the karmic relationship of the cause-and-effect nature of consciousness and matter. 

Now for the relationship to the unfolding of cosmic inflation and the big bang. It is said that our universe, being one of infinite, is formed in stages from elements going from subtle to gross; begining with ""wind"" and settling into ""earth."" The ""winds"" churning, or power, or formation, is dependent on and has a direct relationship with consciousnesses in the formless realm. This wind, in turn,  creates fire, creating water, and then finally earth. Where t=0 in the formation of the universe only ""winds,"" and likewise formless beings,  were present driving inflation and evolution of the universe to the point where conditions for each successive element to form; the very hot dense beginning being fire, then water, then stars and planets corresponding to the element of earth. Each stage, likewise, becomes the physical conditions needed for the individual consciousness from the various realms to reside; as the universe formation evolves so too do its conscious inhabitants.

SO what is dark matter and energy?

I propose, and i am just saying this to spark imagination and possibility:

Dark matter = The beings and other physical planes or dimensions in the universe that we are not able to (and my never be able to) detect 

Dark energy = The forces and interrelationship of matter and consciousness of the various beings that reside within the universe",view comment

It's very special to be able to follow along on the history through the current interpretations of all of these incredible concepts. I'd heard of and read about many of these concepts already, but it's always been difficult to map these discoveries chronologically, and with respect to how each concept interacts with another to help build out the model. We've come a long way since Galileo and even Newton. The only dissatisfying thing about these episodes is the realization that too few of our youth and young adults are being taught these concepts in even their simplest forms. Our younger generations are downright ignorant of these concepts and of the immense bodies of work gone into mapping the history of our reality. They don't understand for even a moment that driving a car or using a cell phone invokes countless invisible and unnoticeable concepts that brilliant minds of the past were determined to solve. In solving them, they made it a possibility to actually harness these things to create technology that today we can't imagine being without. It's so bad nowadays that not only are they ignorant, but they're creating counter-theories and denying previous discoveries. They think of them as conspiracies and frauds. Flat-Earthers and moon landing deniers come to mind, but there are many more that are just too stupid to take seriously. Not enough young people are being taught about scientific discovery in the fields of physics and astronomy, and about how those scientific genres actually affect their lives.

Too bad.

So dark matter.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of p0ru model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

76,,@MrConstitutionDay,26/02/2024 20:25,0,no,no,"It looks like the dark matter subject is rather quiet. I think that the subject is now much more settled. 
I'm looking forward to more scientific edudion on the subject.
Maybe we can see it when the discovery of dark matter has been made. 

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

I know my guess is probably wrong, but it would answer the increase as the universe grows, not an educated guess as I am no scientist and not smart enough to be one just trying to say it in a way I understand.",view comment

There certainly exists a particle physical mold inside the earth that enables composition of our bodies with exactly the same number and type of parts (2 eyes, 32 teeth, 6 main bone types ~ head, torso, 2 arms, 2 legs) being delivered through PLANTS as food, air and water to be assembled by other already delivered ones - several millions of times every single day.

There are no special experiments and/or observations needed to understand this fact, but ONLY the readiness to functionally link the 3 entities (PLANTS, ANIMALS and HUMANS) systematically to derive the mathematical model of this mold to precisely specify how particle interactions inside the earth develop PLANTS on its own surface, to then deliver and sustain beings here through them.

Once we get this model ready we can steer the process in such a way that all evil (disasters, predation, diseases ~ including all birth defects and violence ~ and death) can be PREVENTED by acting on their sources while they are still inside the earth, so that they never reach the surface to harm any being.

Why waste time, efforts and trillions in funds for education and research, when such a simple solution exists to all the problems human race faces, if we are only prepared to consider this possibility seriously?",view comment
