Nobody will tell you that this happened because it makes everything they have said, with such certainty, about the cosmos entirely wrong. Nobody who is respected as being smart wants to say that they have been wrong about everything they have told you, so they cover up things that could prove them wrong. New evidence, unearthed by the assistant to Edwin Hubble, has shown that we live in a static universe of indeterminate age. Nothing is flying apart because there was no big bang.

It's possible that it's an extradimensional form of matter which has effects in our observable dimension. 
This hypothetical dimension of dark matter, having its own unique physics, causes dark matter to behave differently. It has a sort of super-inertia, which speeds up the acceleration of the movement of dark matter, thereby pulling the dark matter (and our galaxies along with it) outward at an exponentially accelerating rate, acting contrary to the physics that we can observe in our own, observable dimension.

I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.
But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.
That's because gravity is not a force.
Gravity is just a joint effect of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.
Details are given below.

Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einstein’s theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects – curvature of spacetime – in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed – it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now – why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system – 3 angular coordinates, ?1, ?2, ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubble’s surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local “mountains” and “valleys” on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of “dark matter”. “Valleys” in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So “dark matter” is really “valleys” in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies – regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, “mountains” in spacetime will repel matter away, an “anti-gravitational” effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The “missing” energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the “circumference” of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.

80,,@nichendrix,01/11/23 15:28:16,1,no,no,"Georges Lemaître was one of the most utterly wronged scientists by the physicist community. He is one of the few physicists that worked through, and made significant contributions to, almost every major subfied of Physics of his time, he worked on quantum mechanics, he did great work on GR, he was one of the pioneers of Computational physics, he worked on climate physics, and many more.

Hubble is known and widely regarded as the person who discovered that the universe is greater than the milk way and that the universe is expanding. But qhen Lemaître read Hubble's paper on cepheid variables, he noticed that is implied that his initial work on General Relativity that suggested that the universe was expanding was probably right, and he even calculated the correct value of the Hubble's Constant almost a year before Hubble even  got enough data to reach that same conclusion nearly a year later. Iet, he was also one of the fathers of the ""Big Bang"" Theory. 

Even the term ""Big Bang"" Theory was coined as a derogatory retort by Fred Hoyle, who, like Einstein, was a proponent of the Steady State Theory of Cosmology, and on an interview to the BCC Hoyle literally stated multiple times that the idea that the Universe had a beginning on a ""Big Bang"" of sorts, was so absurd and without merits that it could have only come out the head of a Priest, not a serious scientist, he said his remarks with derisive and moking tone, because he considered the theory a joke and the fact that Lemaître was a Roman Catholic Priest an even greater joke, a trait that, to Hoyle and many Physicist aalt the time, thought that was something that diminished and put into question any scientific work done by Lemaître, and the fact that it was right wasn't enough to redeem him in their eyes for being a priest, something they considered a very big flaw. 

It took nearly a century for the Hubble Law to be renamed the Hubble–Lemaître law,, and for the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker Metric (FRW Metric), also known as the Friedmann Equations, to be renamed the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric.

The guy was probably one of the first Physicist to make extensive use of computers for simulation and numerical calculus, since before programming languages even existed, and after computers shrank in size and increases inpower and ease of use, he was at the forefront of Computational physics, and used the to work on Nuclear Physics, Solid-State Physics, General Relativity and Statistical Physics in general. He was one of the pioneer who laid down the groundwork needed for Computational Physics to become its own thing and a important branch of Physics.

Yet, you hear a lot about Hubble, Friedman, Einstein, and even Stephen Hawking whose contributions to Physics pale in comparison to Lemaître's contribution, and in great part he is still not acknowledged because he was a Belgian Roman Catholic Priest. Has he been an American, British, German or Russian scientist instead of Belgian, and had him not been a Priest, he would probably have received all the acknowledgements he certainly deserves.",view comment

I know this may not sit well with physicists but I would like to present a very limited understanding of Buddhist cosmology because this presentation takes into account both the physical realms of the universe and non-physical realms of consciousness and may shed some inkling of insight into the ""matter."" 

Just as there are multiple planes or levels of consciousness that we can experience correspondingly, according to Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple planes in which consciousness can reside. Ths most subtle being the ""Formless realm"" where, as the name implies, there is no physical form yet consciousness resides. This is followed by the ""Form realm"", which does contain a subtle physical form, and then the ""desire realm"" where we are. To add to the complexity of this, there are multiple planes of existence within each of these realms in which beings, whose number, like the universe, is infinite, reside according to the karmic relationship of the cause-and-effect nature of consciousness and matter. 

Now for the relationship to the unfolding of cosmic inflation and the big bang. It is said that our universe, being one of infinite, is formed in stages from elements going from subtle to gross; begining with ""wind"" and settling into ""earth."" The ""winds"" churning, or power, or formation, is dependent on and has a direct relationship with consciousnesses in the formless realm. This wind, in turn,  creates fire, creating water, and then finally earth. Where t=0 in the formation of the universe only ""winds,"" and likewise formless beings,  were present driving inflation and evolution of the universe to the point where conditions for each successive element to form; the very hot dense beginning being fire, then water, then stars and planets corresponding to the element of earth. Each stage, likewise, becomes the physical conditions needed for the individual consciousness from the various realms to reside; as the universe formation evolves so too do its conscious inhabitants.

SO what is dark matter and energy?

I propose, and i am just saying this to spark imagination and possibility:

Dark matter = The beings residing on other planes in the universe that we are not able to (and my never be able to) detect 

Dark energy = The forces and interrelationship of matter and consciousness of the various beings that reside within the universe",view comment

When I look at a star for example, there is an electromagnetic connection, if you will, between my eye and that distant star.  My eye is detecting a very minuscule portion of all the energy emitted by that star at some point in the past.  There is an electromagnetic path of mass-converted-to-energy the entire intervening distance from star to eye.   That star, and every other body in the universe that has non absolute zero temperature, is emitting electromagnetic energy of varied frequencies, but emitting none-the-less.  We know that this energy in translation interacts with gravitational fields; bending of light paths etc.  Every emitting body is surrounded by an envelope of energy of rough radius at least as large as it's age in light years.  The energy in translation is ""invisible"" until it reacts with some matter, it is only then that it is detected, that it is revealed.  But what is it's effect on all other bodies while it is in translation in the vacuum of space?  Can this interaction, in translation alone, be a cause for the inexplicable ""observed mass performance"" of the universe; ie need for ""dark matter""?  Mass and energy are interchangeable; all the energy we detect comes ultimately from nuclear mass to energy conversion; stars are mass dissolving into the universe via fusion.  The universe is literally filled with electromagnetic energy in translation, it is bathed in it, translating in every conceivable direction.  My ponder is this: Knowing that electromagnetic energy has momentum and that it interacts with gravity, what is the macroscopic gravitational performance effect of this omnidirectional energy-in-translation field upon the gravitationally interacting bodies of mass in the universe?  What is the consequence if the macroscopic flow of electromagnetic energy is not truly omnidirectional on the universal or even galactic scale but has some resolved vector?",view comment

It is certainly possible to predict the nature of dark matter. Not so much for dark energy.
The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 m asses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.
