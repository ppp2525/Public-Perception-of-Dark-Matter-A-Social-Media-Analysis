21,,@ashkansnake,26/08/19 14:09:20,1,no,no,"NOTES:


1960-70´s
Observing the spiral galaxies 
Rotation of bodies
More distance from the sun, slower the orbiting
Then you can get the sun's gravity
Then you get it's mass
Using the same method for the galaxies 
Movement and velocity is calculated through the Doppler shift 
Lead to unexpected results:
Clouds were moving faster, the farther out from the center
Velocities flattened out with distance instead of declining 
Implying a constant gravity, instead of a decreasing 
What gravity was keeping them from flinging off?
What mass was causing the rapid rotation rates?
We couldn't see them, so...
""Dark"" material is contributing to the gravity
Galaxy must be embedded in a halo of it to fit the shape of the rotation
There must be 5-6 times more of it than visible material
85% of the universe
So what is it? 
Cold gas? Dust? Dead star? Rogue planets? Subatomic particles? 
They didn't emit light
The signs contradicted everything made of normal matter (atoms)
Except invisible subatomic particles from quantum mechanics
These are just possibilities 
Like Axions: has mass, little light and and passes through matter
Space is like a fabric with matter and energy embedded in it 
Gravity is a bending of this fabric 
Like a bowling ball on a mattress would warp its surface
Light bends along the distortion of space caused by gravity
Gravitational lensing: 
Effect of the matter between a light source and its observer, on the light
So: more mass, more gravity, more light bending
A cluster of galaxies have a lot of mass
So by being far away their light bends towards us
Bullet Cluster:
Two colliding galaxies
Their colliding gases get hot and emit x-rays 
Bullet Cluster distorted it's background 
Using that we could map it's mass 
And see the matter that wasn't the hot gas and didn't emit light",view comment

Because physics does not limit the speed of any individual piece of spacetime compared to any other piece... I want to offer a seed of thought. - Gravity moves faster than 'C'. - The old mental experiment... If the sun just vanished... We would see the sunlight for 8(+) minutes... It has been put forward that the Earth would continue to move around where the sun was at for that same 8(+) minutes because the gravity from the sun would also last that long... Because of the speed of 'C'. But if gravity... The warping of spacetime, moves faster than 'C'... The Earth would fling out of orbit faster than the visible light from the sun would vanish. - A gravity wave (or ripple in spacetime) is in effect an Alcubierre-style warp, with no laws of physics limiting it's speed. - I have some possible consequences to this thought. - Let's follow the birth and evolution of a particular gravity wave... I'll call him Gerard. Gerard is formed by the orbits of two massive objects and radiates outward. He behaves as we have learned that he behaves... But at the point where we think that he has expanded (or dissipated) to being ineffective to the matter that he encounters... The actuality of his existence is something different. He joins a vast 'flow' of every bit of gravity ever birthed... And contributes to this flow. Amplifying the other gravity waves... As he is also amplified. This flow has eddies and back-washes where matter accumulates... And becomes (among other things) galaxies. The matter that grows in these eddies of gravity 'flow' can be seen to move too fast for its own gravity and we think it should be spinning itself apart... But actually, the gravity that keeps the galaxies together is from the outside 'flow' - Not the inside mass, or more accurately - both. - Dark matter does not exist... When we map the areas where we see more gravity... and call it dark matter... What we are seeing is the 'flow' of all the gravity that was ever birthed. If we want to move to other parts of this galaxy - And even to other galaxies... We need to harness this 'flow'... And surf. :)",view comment

57,,@richardcollins5549,20/02/20 00:29:36,1,no,no,"Would you please stop using rubber sheets and flexible membranes to represent gravity.  It is three dimensional.  More like a gas with density, pressure, momentum, energy. vorticity, magnetic moment, charge, concentrations of things.  All that is required is a simple 3D visualization like a point cloud.  Please!  a rubber sheet and bowling ball might have been good enough three decades ago, but we certainly can do much better than that now.  If it will help you, then think of the gravitational potential itself, and its associated gradient, the gravitational accelerations. The physical vacuum is not a bad way to remember.  Change the reflectivity, transparency for every voxel according to some reasonable visualization. 


We don't any Internet wide standard for 3D videos.  We should. Then you could change your viewpoint while the 3D video to let you see things from different places, and at different time rates (change over a vast range of frame rates to see details invisible to humans).  If you integrate the gravitational energy density, that value can be calculated for every point in space.  Is it exact or verified?  Not yet. But it is one place to start.  Even simple things like electron densities, axion densities and their respective flows, vorticities and temperature can have complex and beautiful periodic and chaotic structures.  You are representing a complex beautiful field with a cheap visualization.


So this old method is a lot misleading.  At least use the gravitational potential and then color it some way humans can see.  We false color radio telescope pictures and a vast number fields and signals that humans cannot directly see.  There are excellent models for the global gravitational and magnetic fields of the earth at the surface and into space.  They are in spherical harmonic forms, and real time measurement.  It takes a bit of looking to find a decent calculator, then a 3D visualizer.  But not impossible.  Maybe your friendly geophysicist or astrophysicist friends can do it for you.


Most people are not familiar with the gravitational energy density.  I only happened on it back in the 1970's after I met Joe Weber.  He told me to look at his student, Robert Forward's, work.  It is g^2/(8 pi G) in SI units, where g is in (meters/second^2), and G is 6.6743E-11 (meters/second^2) per (kilogram/meter^2).  At the surface of the earth the gravitational energy density is the same as a magnetic field of about 380 Tesla, a laser of 1.7E19 Watts/m^2 or a black body at 2.95 million Kelvin (not sure if this to within a factor 2 based on different model assumptions).  My point is that space is not empty by any means.  Even if you do not fill it with gravitons and axions, the gravitational potential itself is extremely stable and well understood.  At least color that in 3D so people can see it. And you will see that the earth's gravitational potential is dwarfed by the sun.


The gravitational potential changes constantly because of changes in the atmosphere, oceans, and earth on the earth, and changes on the sun and moon and more distant sources of gravitational potential change.  So if you really want to get fancy show how that is changing constantly.  The time dilation equation used for GPS time corrections can be used to show how that changes with time. And it is well defined everywhere in space, so you could plot the rate of clocks, or the vacuum index of refraction, anywhere on earth or in space or on the sun or on the moon - as a function of time.  Many many experiments on earth and in space are now sensitive enough to measure these changes in the potential. And many more can measure the gradient of the gravitational potential, the gravitational acceleration.  Any 3D video would be fine. 


Thank you for listening.  Please don't use that rubber sheet any more. Gravity is not a rubber sheet!!


I have to deal with the gravitational potential every day.  My own view is that it is filled with gravitons, axions, quarks, gluons and neutrinos in different concentrations. These vary in mass and number density, velocity and cross section.  It might be wrong, but that simple step greatly simplified things for me.  And gave me a more concrete thing to ""see"" with my human mind when I try to visualize the action of the gravitational potential field at atomic, subnuclear and global scales.  I guess I am more a chemist.  I like to count moles of gravitons, and not leave them invisible and transparent, even if my human eyes cannot see them.
