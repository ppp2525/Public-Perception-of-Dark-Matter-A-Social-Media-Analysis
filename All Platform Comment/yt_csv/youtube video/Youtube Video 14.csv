19,,@florh,06/06/23 20:43:32,0,no,no,"I'll probably sound ridiculous now, but what I found out about particle physics, is that no matter the theory, the particle is either made up of vibrating strings, or vibrating fields, whatever it is, it's made of energy. The red up quark has energy and vibrates a certain way, the green up quark has energy and vibrates a certain way, the blue down quark has energy and vibrates a certain way, throw a bunch of gluons in the mix with whatever colorcharge they have have energy and vibrate a certain way, the electron in the mix also has energy and vibrates a certain way, and all those energies and vibrations combined, gives us a hydrogen particle (I think), so for me, if I look at that purely as energyfields and how they vibrate, then this entire combination of all that data, that is a tiny little element. You can make muonium too, that particle (?) also has its unique combination of energies that vibrate a certain way.... So my question is, perhaps we cannot see the particle, we can not measure it, but do we have a calculated guess as to which unique combination of energies and vibrations, a dark matter particle could be? Maybe it's a combination that happens during the interactions with the strong force, or weak force? We know probably all feynmann diagrams, how fundamental particles work, which particles are radiated, but maybe a combination of those radiated particles, can give us dark matter (i'm just trying to make a guess, but I suck at explaining), I think my first question was better, do we have a calculated guess as to which unique combination of energies and vibrations a dark matter particle is? The LHC is also planning an update to a detector, giving it a silicone inner core, they were even talking about a 4th dimension, so my best guess is, all our findings will be up for a possible update, in 8 years, when the data of the muon-2 experiment has been compiled and understood, we'll probably need to do an update in physics ever so small or big. So detecting particles, is also going to be more accurate, maybe that's the problem we have now, maybe we try to detect to far from a collision, the particle is already gone before it could be detected.... How many particles are we supposed to find with all the data we have now? 2 left, wasn't there some twin to the higgs? so that makes the graviton and a dark matter particle? What if we found an unknown particle, is that a possibility? though I must admit I never heard of a twin for the higgs, but apparently there is one, I just forgot the name...
Should we think differently about fields? one thing I've wondered is, how much does the temporal in temporal dimension actually mean, that it's temporary or that it's a dimension? For example in m-theory you said that electromagnetism needs 1 dimension, I can only assume this has to be a temporal dimension as long as there is a photon to carry energy on that dimension? It's really hard to believe for me, that any of those tiny little dimensions are spatial, spatial would suggest a lasting dimension, unless the dimensions for gravity because of time are also temporal??? weird questions huh? Well, that's how my head works. Hehe, if you can even send a photon just by lighting a match, I should actually ask when the electromagnetic field actually broke symmetry if it doesn't need that much energy to send a photon, and it was way too hot during EWSB, so did both broke symmetry or just one of them? maybe there is no graviton if gravity is the result of other forces and not a force itself? maybe time broke symmetry and not gravity? anyone postulating timions by any chance, i'm now!!! ????",view comment

34,,@michaelkahn8744,05/07/23 19:48:27,0,no,no,"Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - New model of the Universe can explain ""Dark Matter and Dark Energy""

Einstein’s theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.

However, we also observe gravitational effects – curvature of spacetime – in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed – it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now – why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?

The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system – 3 angular coordinates, ?1,  ?2,  ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.

The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubble’s surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local “mountains” and “valleys” on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of “dark matter”.

“Valleys” in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So “dark matter” is really “valleys” in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies – regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, “mountains” in spacetime will repel matter away, an “anti-gravitational” effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.

Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The “missing” energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.

As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the “circumference” of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted. – Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy",view comment

38,,@Human_01,21/07/23 22:32:24,0,no,no,"ORIGIN-OF-ENERGY [UNIVERSE/DIMENSION]

As Einstein proposed: ""energy is neither created nor destroyed."" 

Energy is the basis of the perceivable universe. Energy exists in countless variations/forms. The qualities of the expanse of energy, as well as the intrinsic properties of it's physical form/outer layer is what dictates a 'type' of energy. 

In quantum mechanics, energy can be observed and scaled in terms of size. They range from the universal to the subatomic/quantum. The smallest of which includes dark matter and dark energy. These are some of the simplest forms of energy/""life"" (conceptual context; energy is core of motion/life. Life is the complex 'regulated-energy-system' that hints at ""intelligent-design""). The correlation between the regulation[system] of energy in a given space or object, and the 'extent'/quantifiable-unit (like Gigabyte or 'storage-unit' of measurement) of the perceivable intelligent-design/consciousness is absolute (i.e. they are undoubtedly related. A kind of Efficiency measuring unit can be created quantify ""life""/extent of ""intelligent-design""). Intelligent-design is life in every context (it hints at it), e.g. even the layered structure of the sun, all the way to cells in the body, and placement of gravitational body's in our solarsytem how's varying levels of regulated-energy-system (courtesy of ""intelligent design""; a conscious-force that regulates and designed our conscious-universe).

Since energy cannot be created nor destroyed, and since it can be converted/transformed into various forms, and physically built up or built down(alter properties, e.g. frequency & vibration), then how did energy come into being in the first place? How did it come to occupy the space[medium] that we call the ""universe?"" The answer: is that energy is released from another dimension[dark-matter: filter/layer consisting fabric of reality] and into the dimension we reside in—much like a pocket that is connected/lined to the outside world. A ""whitehole"" would be example of such an existence.

Diffusion affects dark energy. The dimension pocket it came/leaked from is of a place with a high concentration (of dark energy). That would explain the [similar] moment / behavior that it shares with regular [atomic] particles, e.g. it's tendency to spread, and in a spherical/radiating manner, which indicates it originated from a small point in space. And in the case with diffusion between space of highly different concentration, the initial ""exchange"" is quite ""explosive""; providing high volumes of kinetic energy. The rate of exchange will remain constant depending on the difference/intensity/concentration of dark energy between two spaces. If the rate of dark energy radiation begins to slow down that would imply that the difference in concentration / concentration gradient between two dimensions is reaching equilibrium. In our universe, this would result in the expanse of space so large that atoms wouldn't be able to collide anymore.  

Dark energy would still be leaking into the universe but it would be at a much slower rate, so the literal ""creation process"" would increasingly slow down, e.g. the rate of the birth of a new star would slow down. The result would be a very dull and spacious environment that remains seemingly forever frozen in time. Until one of the concentrated dimensions made contact with a [new] less concentrated one. The greater the difference in concentration between the two the more violent/energetic the explosion of their impact/contact with each other will be, e.g. a more powerful Big Bang. 

Since dark energy is the building blocks of reality, and since it takes up space by radiating within it, and then contracts and compresses to become a denser form of energy, i.e. dark matter (dark-matter is the conscious fabric of space/conscious fabric of reality, and it exists in layers. A black-hole wraps itself in the fabric of space; bending space-time, and by extension dark-matter as well). And eventually becomes a denser form of energy in the form of atoms, and eventually stars, galaxies, and universes...there is a possibility of universes overcrowding (universes are known to attract to each other and merge). 

In such an occasion, were a dimension is pulsing with too many universes (a outerverse-scaled big crunch, i.e. too much material in small space), contraction would occur again (possibly due to increase in gravity), resulting in the compression of denser forms of energy (resembling a red giant), that would then go on to emit and radiate into smaller forms of energy.  These would, again, eventually become dark energy, and it would eventually leak into an other dimension... Repeating the process all over again.

In short, it's a loop. The ""compress, expand, and emit"" process (similarly to a blackholes) seems to be infinite. But the question is what is it that continuously gives said energy direction. Diffusion is one explanation that partly answers this. But why doesn't the dimensions eventually reach equilibrium; to become a space of perpetual stagnation??? 

The answers seems to be that it can't reach equilibrium. —because the dimensions keep pulsating (shrinking and expanding) at different rates in relation to each other. When they make contact, like a bubble, a sudden release of dark energy, driven by momentum (caused by diffusion) is made, and it is in the form of an explosion, i.e. the ""big bang."" Neither dimensions is broken or vanishes. Instead the dimension with a smaller concentration gradient is absorbed into the dimension with a larger gradient. The process happens very slowly, i.e. spanning an near-infinite duration of time. But if you looked at the bigger picture by speeding up time, it would likely resemble a ""bubble"" or ""photon"" bursting < i.e. a sudden by relatively less intense transfer of energy>. Except, like the photon or bubble it didn't bursting into nothingness. Instead, it was only transferred into another environment/dimension.

A whitehole would be a ""big bang"" but on a smaller scale. To reiterate, the point of contact between two [bubble] dimensions is comparable to two portals colliding/making contact with each other. When this occurs, the contents of the dimension with a higher concentration gradient, spills out into the dimension with a lower concentration gradient (rate of diffusion). In our dimension, such an occasion will resemble the big bang or a white hole, i.e. a bright burst of energy, that provides much needed momentum to a stagnating dimension-space, creating new and bigger constructs in the form of universes. The difference in concentration gradient is what decides the size of the explosion, i.e. whether it's a big bang or white hole (small blast).",view comment

M=E/C2. so the problem becomes describing the source, nature and carácter of the energy. look at the map of world Oceanic flow patterns and everywhere you look there are eddies spinning off the main currents, such that a snapshot would show almost as many bodies of water spinning on them selves as those that have a distinct coarse like the ""Conveyor Belt"" ,""Humboldt currant"" etc.

  If as I propose Axions still swirling about in an ""Ongoing Bang"" or more accurately the continuing expansion of the universe then this energy (Fluid mass, therefore fluid gravitational influences), not only explains the missing overall mass but the early formations of over densities of mass in the early universe ""Massive Galaxy clusters etc"".(All without changing the gravitational constant)

I think the most important part of my idear is the creation of cavitations' in the cosmos . The vacuums that are INEVITABLY created when too much energy hits a fluid.  These 'vacuums'  are the 'secondary Couse of acceleration AFTER the energy event that caused them'. As such they are my explanation of why the Universe is accelerating as it is, at different speeds in different places.
I am not academic so don't pretend to understand all the theories you mentioned but apart from the concept of flow(Gravitationally) I am biasing it purely on well established science.
To test my idear I would suggest that there should be ""Venturian""  flow patterns in ""Galaxy groups"".
I note with interest that neither of the two models you featured could explain the  Axial alignment of galaxies. could my Ocean map model?

How much of the following is taken into account when looking at the rotation of a galaxy, and postulating dark matter?

The mass of the inner part has potential, or rotational energy. So according to E = mc2, it's heavier than the sum of the masses of its parts.

The inner parts of a galaxy is therefore heavier than the masses of its parts, i.e., it's suns. That must affect the rotations of the suns further out in the galaxy. But how much?

I don't really belive physicists haven't thought about it all this time. They surely know that energy is mass. But I've never heard this mentioned. So I had to ask!",view comment

86,,@MrConstitutionDay,14/02/24 04:56:21,0,no,no,"Dear Sabine, 
Here's what I think.
See if you agree.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",view comment
