3,,@thekingofmojacar5333,15/04/24 20:00:05,0,no,no,"Black holes (and quasars) are a kind of cosmic recycling station, they transform old matter (stars, planets, etc.) into new matter (energies, particles and light). 
They are of fundamental importance for our cosmos and their functions are varied...   
I assume that the terms dark matter and dark energy are not interpreted correctly. 
As soon as we discover the real reasons for the expansion and connection of galaxies, then we can drop these two terms...   ??",view comment

We have war; hunger, homelessness and backwards society here on earth so why do we think that we need to spend resources exploring space? We can’t even fix what we have here. This is all just a waste.",view comment
