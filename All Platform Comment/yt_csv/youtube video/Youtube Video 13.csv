26,,@effectingcause5484,05/09/23 02:33:19,0,no,no,"I can explain why the stars are orbiting too fast on the outer edges of galaxies without the need for any dark matter ideas. 
Consider instead that it is gravitational time dilation which causes the outer stars to only appear to be orbiting faster, this being due to their distance from the super massive black hole in the center. The stars orbiting closer to the center of the galaxy are experiencing a slower pace of gravitational time dilation than stars orbiting farther away from the center. The stars which are farthest away from the center are actually orbiting at the correct speed according to Einsteins field equations, except they only appear to rotate faster because the orbiting stars can be viewed as a giant galactic clock which is ticking off time faster for the outer stars than it does for the inner stars, all due to gravitational time dilation which depends on the distance from the supermassive black hole which all the stars orbit around. The inner stars are standing in a stronger gravitational field than the outer stars and experience a slowing of their clocks. The galactic clock ticks off time much slower for inner stars. The outer stars experience a speeding up of their clocks because they’re so far away from the strong gravitational field nearer the center mass of the galaxy, and so the galactic clock ticks off time faster for the outer stars. This makes the outer stars appear to be orbiting too fast. We should actually expect to see the stars appear to move overly fast on the outskirts of spiral galaxies where gravity is weaker than near the center.",view comment

No, we need to audit the existing models and not simply fabricate the existence of a substance solely based on it's existence making the models work better.  Based on the scientific method, it's existence can be hypothesized based on it working to improve the model but before it can become theory, a bunch of tests and experiments must be done to positively detect and confirm its existence.  Instead, it seems scientists changed the order.  Calling its existence a theory solely based on it making the math work and performed experiments later.  Experiments that have all failed to prove its existence.  Perhaps the problem that scientists want dark matter to be the answer for is actually the result of flawed model (flawed math)?  It makes sense that such flaws would result in a problem that can only be corrected by something that doesn't actually exist.",view comment

49,,@Nabraska49,06/10/23 20:28:34,0,no,no,It would be interesting to see see a model of the universe that assumed that time or space time is released from matter by black holes and that time is attracted to matter and becomes matter and then matter is attracted to matter becoming so massive that it becomes a black hole or it is drawn into a black hole only to be released back into the universe as time once again .. and if you assume that time rushing into matter has the side effect of what we call gravity. So if you feel like you are being attracted to the earth it is more like you are being pushed onto the earth like standing under a water fall . The universe is like a huge water tank full of water and matter is like tiny holes in that tank and the black holes are like the pumps pumping water back into the tank and like the water going down a bathtub drain you get the spiral you get the same with the solar systems and galaxies. The more time that is released from matter in the black holes you get an expanding universe and once a black hole runs low on fuel or matter it would probably explode and as mass absorbed time the universe would be contracting… until the time is converted back into matter creating a lot of matter that accumulates to the point that it becomes a black hole again and it starts all over again . I call this the universal Spencer theory.. all we need now is some very clever people to see that time is matter and energy and everything and to make a model based on this concept work .,view comment

Would also explain dark energy as simply being the incomprehensible distant gravitational pull of super-clusters competing around us ""for us"" and dragging us apart.

Matter always sinks into its place on the mat of spacetime, perpetually, stretching the fabric in between. Which then stretches exponentially.

The observable universe is only the event horizon of our gravitational sinkhole, just going down without end for eternity.

It also explains how satellites have a stable orbit, they sink into their own endless gravitational well as fast as the thing they orbit pulls them which counteracts the gravitational 'sinking' of thr satellite.

What I'm trying to say is that mass is only internally stable. It is dynamically ""increasing"" all the time, but this only manifests on the scale that is in-between galaxy clusters. And it is how masses 'pull' at all: things only attract each-other because they're inside each other's gravitational sinkhole, it's also why gravity expands, while it ""reaches out"" it also sinks deeper.

This would also mean that black holes travel faster and faster into the future, and so do we. And this would mean the space in-between clusters that is being stretched is temporally slowing down—because it experiences negative mass by being stretched in the reverse way that black holes increase in mass.",view comment

He found interactions between galaxies preclude the presence of a dark matter halo, which, if present would have a friction-like effect that would slow visible matters interaction, but that effect was not observed at all.  According to Dr. Kroupa, DM halos have been falsified to a 5 signma confidence.  I'm not sure if any of these proposed modifications to DM you mention in the video address that falsification, or you have some other reason to doubt Dr. Kroupa's work on this subject, but if so I would like to hear it.  He believes that Dr. Milgrom's MOND is a better explanation for the rotation of galaxies.  There are problems with MOND, such as gravitational lensing and bullet clusters, but I've seen some efforts to harmonize those observations with a version of MOND.  For one thing, bullet clusters may be explainable if there is baryonic matter like dust and black holes, than we just can't see (something like an additional 50 percent matter) under MOND without the need for any dark matter.  But this video seems to side-step the issues raised by Dr. Koupa and only focuses on the more recent problems raised with DM.",view comment

When considering our sun is a G-Type main sequence star with an Oort Cloud of a given scale, volume and mass, would it be fair to theorise that at least most of all the other G-type stars within our galaxy would have one too? (And possibly consider a vast majority of stars of any type would have also) Is all this extra mass (which I’d presume to be only an extremely small fraction of what’s needed to dismiss the presence of dark matter given the effects observed in galactic rotation curves).. But given the predicted volume of space occupied by a given Oort could this would make the volume of ‘empty space’ as it were between stars would be vastly reduced. IF we considered a given stars volume in space to ‘end’ at the outer surface of its Oort Cloud, meaning that the individual masses of stars (Including any orbiting planets, possible asteroid & Kyper belts and its Oort Cloud etc) and combine all that mass would that not ‘even’ it out a bit more? 

Also when moving into the centre of a galaxy stars become more concentrated, gravitational effects on each other are bigger etc could factors such as the extreme heat, radiation etc turn these inner stars hypothetical Oort clouds into gas which then gets thrown out into the outer arms of our spiral galaxy by centrifugal interactions (meaning the heavier stars get pulled in by the intense gravity at the core, occupying the space and the lighter gas being ejected to settle down in the outer arms) .. Could this extra matter between all the billions of stars have an effect on what we see? Does Astro physics, galaxy rotation behaviour take this into account? I’m 100% sure you all do .. Could you possibly explain your predictions/theories on that? For example how much mass does billions of Oort clouds add to the combined mass of a galaxy and if it negates (If any) a given calculated mass presence needed by dark matter.",view comment

It is used to describe the electromagnetic field and concludes that not only the energy of the electric field generates gravity but also it's divergence does. The acceleration is an unusual Reeb Class vector, not the ordinary Reeb vector. There is an offer of how the generalize the theory to other force fields. The energy of the electric field is stored in a weak acceleration field, 8.61 cm/sec^2 for 1000000 volts/1mm but due to charge gravity, it is lower, 4.305cm/sec^2. The outcome is a surprise, charge itself generates gravity and anti-gravity, (-,+)5.802135 *10^9 Kg/Coulomb. Charge is coupled with a non geodesic bivector but the divergence of the energy momentum tensor does vanish. This cannot be used in a high voltage capacitor to generate a Hermann Bondi inertial dipole due to the dielectric layer's anti-alignment of induced dipoles. There must be a solution, however, that will reach a breakthrough propulsion technology. Positively charged gas and dust can account for part of the Dark Matter effect and intergalactic electrons can account for part of the Dark Energy effect.

If a hurricane or tornado can be mustered up by mere air, how much force would a SUPER MASSIVE BLACK HOLE and surrounding gaseous stars swirling around a common center like Sagittarius A STAR. Heat always travels from a warmer substance to a colder one. That’s the law. A hot object will heat a cold one. If the cold one is big enough, it will simply rob the heat instantly. If it’s slow, it will radiate and conduct if it’s touching, and convection if there’s a stark contrast in temperatures. What holds the galaxy together isn’t extra mass, it’s FORCE from energized stars force circling the black hole at our center. This completely gets rid of any need for HIDDEN MASS. Now, I’m sure there are condensate materials that give off no visible light waves or rays. So there may be some extra mass unaccounted for. But the true reason it doesn’t fly apart, is that IT IS A STORM. And it’s ok, we still need you guys to keep grinding out math. But sometimes the math lies. Like a singularity and infinite density. All that means is ALL POSSIBLE FUTURES POINT TO THE BIG DENSE MASS. It stops time and locks out empty space that belongs in a cores volume. Expansion by displacement. Each mass is a GROWTH that must be gone around. Creating gravity and blowing out the edge. If we sink a beach ball into a pool representing SPACE TIME and MATTER. Masses swell the greater volume if space. When we began with the BIG BANG we were hot and dense. Now we have all this stuff that TAKES UP SPACE.

All of the matter we see in deep space like 200 billion light years and more, is in the past. We might be seeing it now, because it’s light is finally reaching us. But it could be gone. Like a smoke screen carcass of what used to be. We’re on such a microcosm point of view, that things that happen instantly on the MACRO SCALE appear to us as OBECTS still there.

Like a sort of resonance or self inductance where the effect of gravity is governed by more than just the amount of stuff there is. After all we still dont really understand the origin of gravity. If it turns out that gravity emerges from the interaction between matter and space over time then that would mean there are at least two variables that can influence the gravity that exists in a region of space,view comment

It just needs to square itself topologically and with appropriate math and physics.
It's not all that hard.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

94,,@NaturalFuture,18/03/24 20:05:13,0,no,no,"Is there really such a thing as ""normal"" matter? Where'd educated people get that expression, anyway--from the Simpsons? Sounds very cartoonish, and used by those who are too lazy to find the most precise name for something they don't quite understand. Here's what I call it, based on what logic and language strongly suggest:  Visible matter, or v-matter. Why's that? Because it's visible. As for its opposite--the form of matter which supposedly exists but that you can't see, it shouldn't be called ""dark"" matter, but rather invisible matter, or i-matter. When you deal with two things in opposition (say, top v. bottom) but change to two terms that aren't in opposition (top v. left), it throws the entire description out of balance.

Moreover, how can just one be called normal? Does that make so-called ""dark"" matter abnormal? But, how can that be when scientists say that visible (aka ""normal"" matter) makes up 26% of the universe while ""dark"" matter makes up 5% of the cosmos? Obviously, both are normal. Yet, one is of a type you can easily detect, the other of a type that's difficult. (The way these people give the two types of matter names, they might as well, respectively, call one ""easy"" matter, for 'easy to detect'; and the other ""difficult"" matter, because it's difficult to detect.) What about ""dark"" energy? Is that abnormal, simply because it's hard to detect? How can that be whe when scientists say the cosmos is made of 69% of it? Interesting how language can be misused, and misleading.

Thus, you can see how the version I propose is logical, precise, and enlightening. Yes, the form of matter--and energy--that we can find, see, and understand with relative ease should be called ""visible,"" while the type that's difficult to find, see, and understand should be called ""invisible"" matter and energy. Better yet: V-mattergy and I-mattergy.",view comment
