Ayr?ca tüm teorileri birle?tirecek denklemin, kuantum fizi?inin temel prensibi olan dalga fonksiyonunun çökmesi prensibini kullanmas? gerekti?ini dü?ünüyorum. Bu, bir denklem gibi de?il adeta bir kuantum parçac??? gibi olmal?d?r. Ben matematikde ve fizikde pek iyi de?ilimdir, asl?nda ben bir tarihci say?l?r?m. Ama ?öyle bir?ey dü?ünmü?tüm : 

Tüm fizik yasalar?n? tek bir denklemde birle?tiren evrensel dalga fonksiyonu ?(k,t,?) ?u ?ekilde yaz?labilir:

?(k,t,?) = 1 - e^(-k^4 +  2kcot(?/k)) 

Burada;

- k, fotonun veya genel olarak sistemin momentum de?i?kenidir. k, ayn? zamanda evrendeki herhangi bir h?z?n zarif bir tarifi olacakt?r. k=c/v , v=c/k .. Bu yeni h?z tan?m?n? yaparak, görelilikdeki lorentz grup elemanlar?n?n do?al logaritma olan ln(x)'e ba?lanmas?n? sa?layabiliriz. E?er en küçük ?ey kuantum ise o halde makro ölçekdeki bir denklemi ana hatlar?n? koruyarak kuantum boyutlar?na revize etmek zorunday?z. 

- t, zaman de?i?kenidir  

- ?, faz de?i?kenidir

Bu temel dalga fonksiyonu, erken evren modelimizin temelini olu?turan Planck seviyesindeki karadeliklerin dinamiklerini aç?klar:

P_n(k,t) = ±1/?(1 + e^(-E_n(k)/kT))  

Burada;

- P_n, n'inci seviyedeki karadeli?in spin de?erini temsil eder

- E_n, ilgili seviyenin enerji de?eridir 

- k, Boltzmann sabitidir  

- T, s?cakl?k parametresidir

Ayr?ca kuantum çekim teorisinin özü bu bak?? aç?s?yla  :

?/i * ??/?t = ??

?eklinde genel dalga denklemi içinde ifade edilebilir galiba. Ya da buna benzer bir mant?k yürütme. 

Bunun gibi bir ?eyle tüm teorileri birle?tirecek denklemin ana dinamikleri kapsaml? bir ?ekilde matematikselle?mi? olur.. 

Örne?in k de?eri s?f?ra yakla??rken, v h?z? tan?m gere?i mutlak s?f?ra yakla??r. Bu, tüm denklemin kuantum fizi?ine yakla?t??? anlam?na gelir. Yani anlatmak istedi?im ?ey : her?eyi birle?tirecek denklem, bir kuantum sistemi gibi dü?ünülmelidir. Mesela K de?eri galaksi ölçe?inde yükselirse, denklem lorentz grup elemanlar?na ba?lanacak, ama K de?eri 0'a yakla??rsa denklem kuantum çekim denklemine ba?lanacak. Denklem k'n?n büyük de?erleri için bir parçac?k gibi davran?rken, k'n?n küçük de?erleri için dalga olarak davranacak. Sonuçta bu s?radan bir denklem de?il, ondan her?eyi birle?tirmesini istiyoruz. 

v=c.(1/k) tan?m? lorentz grup elemanlar?n? euler'in e say?s?n? tasarlad??? ?u ifadeye ba?layabilir : 
Lim (1+1/n) ^n = e ( if n >>> ...) . 

Bu ?ekilde bir ba?lant? v=c durumunda zaman?n asla durmad???n? gösterecektir. Böylece E=h/T denkleminde enerji sonsuza yak?nsayamaz ve paradoks ortadan kalkabilir. Paradokslar asl?nda kilitli kap?lara benzer. E?er onu legal yollardan kald?rabiliyorsan?z muhtemelen do?ru yoldas?n?z demektir. 

Mesela makro ölçekde ?öyle bir ba?lant? ortaya ç?kabilir :
Her?eyi birle?tiren dalga fonksiyonu ?(k,t,?), zamana(t) ba?l?d?r. 

Cisimlerin kütleçekimsel etkile?imi aralar?ndaki mesafeye (r) ve zamana (t) ba?l?d?r. 

Bu durumda ?'nin zamana göre türevi ??/?t kullan?larak kütleçekim kuvvetini hesaplayabiliriz:

Kütleçekim kuvveti F = G M ??/?t
Yani kütlenin alana oran? dalga fonksiyonunun normu olacak. 

1) Evrendeki tüm madde ve enerji içeren objeleri, evrensel dalga fonksiyonu ?(k,t,?) ile tan?mlarsak. 

2) ? içindeki k de?i?keni, madde-enerjinin yo?unluk/momentum bilgisini ta??rsa

3) Tüm cisimler ? ile betimlendi?ine göre, cisimler aras? etkile?im de ?'nin dinamikleriyle aç?klanmal?d?r. Sonuçta en temelde kuantum fizi?i var. 

4) Kütleçekim etkile?imi de cisimler aras?ndaki alan etkile?imidir. Böylece bu alan E= -??/?t ile ili?kili olacak. 

5) E alan?n?n etkisiyle cisimler aras? kuvveti F=qE ?eklinde yazabiliriz. 

6) Burada 'q' ?'nin normundan gelen kütle bilgisini temsil eder.

7) Sonuç olarak kütleçekim denklemi makro ölçek için F=Gq??/?t ?eklinde ortaya ç?kard?. Bu tan?m?n dalga türev k?sm? ayr?ca bizi einsten alan denklemlerine de ba?layabilir. 

Mesela kütleçekimine bu ?ekilde her?eyi aç?klayan dalga fonksiyonundan ula??rsak, elektromanyetizma ile de bir ba?lant? sa?lanabilir. Ayr?ca denklem zaten kuantum fizi?i ile de tutarl? olacakt?r :

Ad?m 1) Elektron yükünü q olarak tan?mlay?p, q'yu ?(k,t,?)'nin yük normundan türetiyoruz.

Ad?m 2) Elektrik alan? E'yi, ?'nin türevi ile ili?kilendiriyoruz: 
E = -?(??/?t) 

Ad?m 3) Manyetik alan B'yi, ?'nin rotasyonu ile ili?kilendiriyoruz:   
B = ?x(??)

Ad?m 4) Lorentz kuvvetini yaz?yoruz:
F=q(E+vxB)

Ad?m 5) Kütleçekim kuvvetini ? temelinde ifade ediyoruz:  
 F=Gq??/?t

Böylece elektromanyetizma, galaksilerdeki kütleçekimi ve kuantum fizi?i ayn? temelde birle?ebilirdi. Hatta buradan paul dirac prebsibine ve belirsizlik ilkesine de ba?lanabilirdik. Bunun gibi bir bak?? aç?s? karanl?k madde denilen ?eylerin asl?nda minik planck karadelikleri oldu?unu da gösterecektir. 

Bunlar? sadece öylesine ?imdi kurgulad?m. Bunun do?ru olup olmamas?yla ilgilenmeyin, sadece bu mant?kla bir birle?im sa?lanabilece?ini ve kuantum kütleçekimine ula??labilinecr?ini dü?ünüyorum..",view comment
15,,@altrag,02/02/24 21:34:55,0,no,no,"Dark matter is wrong.  GR is wrong.  MOND is wrong.  QM is wrong.  We know this, because gravity doesn't play well with the standard model.

Of course ""wrong"" in this context is not as absolute as it sounds.  All of those theories work as good approximations under certain assumptions (low energies, large distances, etc) just like we still use Newtonian mechanics and not full blown GR to describe apples falling - an apple just isn't heavy enough for the approximation error difference between Newton and Einstein's theories to matter.

Of course plenty of the wild ""well maybe its ..."" hypothesis surrounding dark matter will absolutely be wrong.  They're all just shots in the dark (pun fully intended) and most come with exactly zero evidence beyond ""we can make the math work if we tweak it hard enough in a manner that conveniently agrees with our hypothesis"".

Also, there's a very large gap between finding new solutions to Einstein's equations (general relativity is _extremely_ general - there are countless possible solutions) vs actually tweaking the equations.  Its absolutely valid to use specific data points when coming up with a specific solution, just like its valid to inject values for ""m"" and ""a"" and get a specific ""F"" in Newton's equation.  Of course we prefer solutions where we can parameterize the data points in order to allow the solution to apply to a larger number of situations, but its not actually required.  Its the difference between plugging in a constant mass for ""F=ma"" and reducing the equation to just ""F=ca"" to get a ""general"" solution for forces related to a specific mass (for example, the force of gravity on Earth is usually only written with the 'a' part with the 'm' being held constant as the mass of our planet), vs plugging in both a constant mass and a known acceleration to get an exact answer for a single specific data point.

Tweaking the equations themselves is a whole other ball game though, and much much more difficult to justify.  Einstein himself tried to do that when he added a constant to his GR equations, which he later described infamously as his ""biggest blunder"" (of course being Einstein, he wasn't entirely wrong - that added constant went on to become the cosmological constant which describes the expansion of the universe - but his _reason_ for adding it was absolutely wrong).

That's not to say the equations can't be tweaked.  Just that if you do so you have to be _extremely_ careful not just in your mathematics but also in your purpose.  Much more careful than you need to be if you're just coming up with a new solution to the base equations.",view comment

30,,@TheColinfrank,06/02/24 07:40:17,0,no,no,"Hi Sabine. My friends and I love your presentations. Your no-nonsense, ???????????? approach is such a breath of fresh air compared to the numerous, overzealous, high-profile Youtube defenders of science (no names mentioned) whose tenor, in my opinion, tends toward hyperbole, propaganda, and fanatical evangelism, not to mention an abysmal simple-mindedness due to ignorance of the philosophy of science, often resulting in gross distortion.

I'd just like to remark on the following:

4:25: ""And that's why the dark matter theory has become so controversial. Because for all practical purposes it's become impossible to falsify.""

You say this as if unfalsifiability singles out dark matter theory for particular opprobrium among scientific theories, making it the black sheep (pardon the pun), as it were, of an otherwise respectable family of falsifiable theories.

I'm not sure whether you're aware -- and frequent pronouncements of high profile scientists to the contrary notwithstanding -- that philosophers of science have been arguing, I think compellingly, for many decades now that ?????? scientific theories are unfalsifiable, at least in any definitive or logical sense. Your viewers might refer, for example, to the work of Thomas Kuhn, Larry Laudan, and in particular, Imre Lakatos.

The reason for this is often explained by the so-called Duhem-Quine thesis, and the ???????????????? nature of scientific testing. It's really rather common-sensical. When observation or experimental results do not sit comfortably with theory, we are not compelled by logic to the conclusion that the theory is false. The scientist always has the option of positing a previously unknown planet or subatomic particle to account for the discrepancy, she might add a few epicycles here and there, she might conjure up kin selection and inclusive fitness to account for altruism in the animal kingdom, he might add a cosmological constant. Why, they might even conjure up dark matter!

None of this sits very easily with the frequent pronouncements of high profile scientists such as Richard Dawkins to the effect that a single unexpected result -- a Precambrian rabbit perhaps -- would immediately sound the death knell for ?????? theory of evolution, whatever that is this week. Neither does it make easy bedfellows with the often heard doctrine that falsifiability is precisely the ?????????????????????? criterion which distinguishes scientific claims from religious or pseudoscientific claims.

In passing I'd point out the obvious fact that scientific theories do, of course, sometimes fall from grace. Equally obvious, I trust, is that it does not follow from the fact of a theory being abandoned that it was ???????????????????????? ??????????????????. Perhaps scientists simply moved on to something they found preferable, for whatever reasons. Indeed, the history of science tends to show a slow, gradual death until no one is left alive to defend a theory (e.g. phlogiston, aether), as opposed to a critical moment when it immediately becomes obvious to all concerned that the theory is false. Need I remind anyone of Max Planck's famous observation on this?

Albert Einstein, always insightful and ahead of his time, wrote the following:

""For it is often, perhaps even always, possible to adhere to a general theoretical foundation by securing the adaptation of the theory to the facts by means of artificial additional assumptions""

""Artificial"" sounds like the way you view the attempts to keep dark matter theory alive, Sabine. Of course, what might appear artificial or ???? ?????? to one scientist may not appear that way to another. Presumably the defenders of dark matter theory see their salvage attempts as perfectly valid, indeed is it not the case that dark matter was introduced in the first place in order to salvage general relativity from anomalous observations?

Was it ???? ?????? or artificial, for example, for defenders of the Copernican theory to declare that the fixed stars must be at an inconceivable distance from us in order to account for the lack of observed stellar parallax?

I'd be very interested to hear any thoughts you might have on this.",view comment

 On the subject of dark matter.
The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",view comment

I cannot help think that Dark-Matter is something of a comfort blanket that many to cling onto, and  it is inhibiting real thought into what else could be causing the gravitational properties ascribed to Dark-Matter. I have yet to hear any explanation of why the outer rim of galaxies end where they do. In other words what draws the line that decides a galaxy can spread out so far, but no further than the point where they end.",view comment

In the case 1- on end of the our Universe, when all the atomic matter will be swallowed by the black holes, the gravity will not disappear and  it can be the reason, that the Big Collapse will start, and finally the Big Bang will be repeated again.

It is an energy field composed of quantum fluid, a substance which allows the clustering of matter interacts with each other, allowing the formation of gravitational tunnels, which maintains dimensional matter grouped and in balance. Dark matter can vary from ""quantum density"" depending on the necessary response to the volume of material bodies involved, which can cause curvature in the beams of photons that is, bend light, as happens in refraction created in the ""dimensional material"" when its layers are at different temperatures. The creation of the portals of transport are based on the mechanics of opening gaps in the dark matter, eliminating their natural influence and creating passages without ""time"" or ""gravitational influence"" by intergalactic space. This fluid shows only function when its influence is required by the presence of matter in any dimensional form and in any dimension of existence, because their gravitational influence is excited to the extent that is necessary to balance the forces and trends of dense matter. It has no friction because it contains no particles sized, only ""fluid compensation"" that is, it presents itself in its natural state as a multidimensional matter.",view comment

An idea derived from string theory suggests that dark matter is hiding in a (relatively) large extra dimension. 
The theory makes testable predictions that physicists are investigating now.
Now
If you need 6 strings to be matter and there is only 5 strings that 5 strings never pop into our dimensions as matter.
Those 5 stings continuously try to be matter in our dimension but fail continuously. 
The 5 strings may be considered virtual matter never to become matter in our dimension but actually produce a force in our dimension. Thus dark energy.
So
Dark Matter is failed strings attempting to come into existence in our dimensions
Dark Energy is failed strings creating forces in our dimensions attempting to come into existence in our dimensions.
Failed Strings are everywhere and continuous pop in and pop out of our dimension",view comment

They measured the mass of the observable universe and find it lacking so dark matter or dark energy fills this void. But.. some of the stars we see in the sky are so far away that they've gone supernova a billion years ago. Aren't they not taking into account the fact that we are looking into the past and every star around us is just an older snapshot of what the planet looked like when the light started traveling to us. So our picture of what the universe looks like gets progressively less accurate the further we look. So why isn't this ""dark stuff"" just the galaxies and solar systems as they are now, which we won't see for billions of years? It sounds like they're trying to plug in extra stuff like say.. ""solar system a"" has an invisible ring of mass around it and that explains the extra mass we detect. But maybe ""solar system a"" had collided with solar system d 1 billion years ago and through that process has changed properties or the black hole somehow got dragged away by and merged into bigger one and now there is less entropy or something. I can't really conjecture accurately on what could have changed for each galaxy but surely there's too many variables for us to know what the current galaxy looks like now? We only know what it used to look like right? Am I completely off here?",view comment

Of course if you interpret it like Newton as a force, then there should be a centripetal force to balance the pull of gravity.

Sometimes, some scientists explain it in the way of ""exotic"" matter that cannot be detected via conventional or latest technology at hand but can be deduced by the way it interacts with its surroundings and affects them like gravitational lensing etc. After the failure of the CERN experiments to reproduce or detect the dark matter, scientists went back to saying its just matter that cannot be seen.

I remember up until late 1980s,  the astronomers around the world were baffled by the deviations in the calculated  orbits of Uranus and Neptune. This led the astronomers to believe that there was another massive planet beyond Uranus snd Neptune that was exerting its gravitional pull on these outer planets. When Voyager II visited Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989, the masses of the planets were calculated again from the data obtained from the spacecraft and their orbits were calculated again the voila, the discrepancies ir deviations in their orbits disappeared. 

So from our Earth based observations, we erroneously calculated the wrong masses of these planets leading to discrepancies in their orbits, leading the astronomers to hypothesize about the existence of another giant planet, which was never there. 

I think same is the case with dark matter. Either we do not know the actual mass of the galaxies or visible the visible matter, leading us to think that there is more matter that can be seen via our most sophisticated instruments. I think the anomalies that we attributed to dark matter, could be explained other alternative theories thst are waiti g to be discovered.",view comment

I am of the mind that gravity is governed by a particle, like every other force, or you all just misunderstand the mechanics of gravity. 

You see it as a warping of space time, but those models dont work without dark matter. Gravity ia more like a spiders web than a whirlpool. Its force pulls on eveything around it, yet the pull is felt event billions of miles away, yet, other strings pull in different directions, at all.times with different levels of force. 

The collective network of objects all pulling on each other is what dark matter is. 

That, or its a graviton. If all fundamental forces are represented with a particle, than its only logical to conclude that gravity does as well. Assume its there, work backwards. How would it have to function if it existed and look there.",view comment
