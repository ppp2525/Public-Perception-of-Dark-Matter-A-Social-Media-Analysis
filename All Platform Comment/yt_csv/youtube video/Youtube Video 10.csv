31,,@ronaldkemp3952,14/02/23 20:01:11,0,no,no,"I've got a general question for ya.

Dark matter is blamed on the extra motion occurring to our solar system as it orbits around the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.  We're traveling at a velocity of around 536,000 mi/h.  But according to general relativity and the laws of motion because we're located some 26,000 light years from the barycenter, we're supposed to be traveling at about 90,000 mi/h.  There is a discrepancy of around 450,000 mi/h between what was measured and what was predicted.  The extra motion is pinned on dark matter.

My question, if dark matter was causing the sun to be traveling so fast, 450,000 mi/h then why doesn't it affect the motion of the Earth, planets and other small bodies as they orbit the sun?  

According to the laws of motion matter falls at the same rate, regardless of weight or density.  A bowling ball and a feather fall at the same rate in a vacuum.  This was proven many times before.  So if the sun is being affected by dark matter, and the gravity produced by this missing mass is the only force acting upon visible matter, then why is the Earth, planets and other small bodies not affected?  They should be affected just like the sun and all other stars and satellite galaxies orbiting the central black hole.  

But dark matter doesn't affect the motion and orbits of planets and moons.  Why is that?  If the mass of dark matter particles were acting upon the sun causing it to move 450,000 mi/h too fast, then why doesn't it affect the motion of the planets and moons too?  Planets and moons would be much closer to the dark matter halo than the sun. They should be affected too as they orbit around the sun, more so than the sun.",view comment

The gravitational phenomena observed by astronomers, which are explained by the existence of dark matter, are the result of the expansion of space in time. The expansion of space is equivalent to the straightening of a deflection of space. Gravity, described by Einstein's equations as the deflection of space-time, is possible only in the higher spatial dimension, which many do not pay attention to. A galaxy spinning in expanding space reduces gravity to the square of the distance between planets, stars, and black holes as space-time expands. Therefore, the rotation curves of galaxies are rectified, that gravity is greater at first and then decreases as space itself expands.

Dark matter is a theoretical magical matter that was invented over 100 years ago by some guy who applied newtons law while looking at a galaxy and realized that the outer most objects were not spinning around the galactic center as slow as orbital mechanics dictated. They did move at the right speed if the guy toke into account that the galaxy was heavier then he estimated the weight to be at. To him, fudging the numbers to get the right answer meant that the problem was that he was not seeing the missing matter instead of assuming the math to be wrong. Because maths in a era they had not gone to the moon yes was obviously not flawed, he theorized that there is somehow a dark, invisible form of matter. 

Modern dark matter believers say that over 70% of the universe matter is dark matter, how every they are not able to detect or prove that it exist. 
In essence dark matter is the modern version of ""i dont understand lighting, therefore it is god who is angry"".

Currently there is a lot of scientist who are working with models to fix the equation that we use for gravity. In essence fixing the math instead of inventing something that clearly does not exist. Turns out, most of these works require just a minute adjustment, Sadly, the belief in dark matter which goes against the scientific principle is so encrusted now that to prove the dark matter believers wrong, their mathematical formula has to essentially also account for all the dumb shit they also say is the work of dark matter which is ridiculous since they basically have to prove the earth is round and as far as we know also show that the same proof explains why the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, too things that as far as we know are unrelated except they have no proof.

I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.
But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.
That's because gravity is not a force.
Gravity is just a joint effect of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.
Details are given below.

Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einstein’s theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects – curvature of spacetime – in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed – it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now – why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system – 3 angular coordinates, ?1, ?2, ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubble’s surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local “mountains” and “valleys” on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of “dark matter”. “Valleys” in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So “dark matter” is really “valleys” in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies – regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, “mountains” in spacetime will repel matter away, an “anti-gravitational” effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The “missing” energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the “circumference” of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.

67,,@odenwalt,12/08/23 12:43:56,0,no,no,"16:05 This is where you go off the rails...........  The Heisenberg uncertainty principal does not govern physics.  It is a principle about knowing to different bits of information about a system simultaneously.  It is a measurement problem.  The more you know about velocity, the less you know about location.  This has nothing to do with physical densities and is not a reason for differences in physical densities.  You aren't just confusing the measurement with what you are measuring, but confusing the interpretation of the measurement with what you are measuring.  You also infer a causation correlation fallacy in your statement.  This is as fallacious as when particle physicists make statement like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows for pairs of particles to come into existence and annihilate each other before they can be measured.  Uncertainty also implies that the universe needs observers for physics to happen............ Statements like timeframe 16:05, allow the insertion of mathematical models that do not represent reality to be inserted as if they are fact.  Using uncertainty as the reason something happens makes as much sense as, taking the primary injectors offline and rerouting auxiliary power through the main deflector.  Philosophically speaking, being right for the wrong reason is still being wrong, regardless of coincidental outcomes or predictions.",view comment

When you look at the pie chart, and see that the vast majority of ""stuff"", is apparently not discovered yet, you have got to understand the math is wrong.

Seriously, we have a theory called the BIG BANG, that was followed by something that could not happen... INFLATION... and then to explain all that can't be explained, you invent something and a form of math that somewhat helps explain things... you again have to know it's just all wrong.
Remember, everyone thought that electrons protons and neutrons could not be divided... only got that 1/3 right.... and we thought gravity came from the graviton... well, you know how that's turned out.
This is no periodic table with actual points in it that you can nicely fit in a form of energy and matter.
The ripples in the formation of the universe are just ripples in the fabric of the universe that is all quantum in nature. 
The apparent acceleration of the universe is not more than a ripple in space, and while I'm on it, won't mention time, as time does NOT exist... it is simply a mechanism created by man to make large scale calculations possible with our limited math ability. It's like a wave reaching the shores and getting bigger and apparently having more affect  on the surrounds... but it's just a ripple.
If you think that space is expanding faster and faster, then it must reach a point at some stage in the future where it can no longer support the quantum nature of matter and at that point everything will instantly disappear... and well, I'm fairly sure that is not going to happen.
There will never be a theory of everything, because there can be no theory that will work on the level of a Universe, and then down at the field level of the universe.
Stop trying to create matter and energy that doesn't exist, that fits in to our current math, and understand, you'll need to get string theory down pat and understand the nature of the fields that make up space before we have any idea of how the universe is really working.",view comment

91,,@MrConstitutionDay,23/02/24 05:44:33,0,no,no,"It's a ubiquitous question ""what is dark matter""? The author is concerned with the standard  model, and his credibility. So obvious solutions to this thorny question cannot be addressed. 
The following answer should not be ignored.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.
