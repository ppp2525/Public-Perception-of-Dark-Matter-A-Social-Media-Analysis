The miniscule force that holds together observable particles is an electronic attraction. We generally rely on the charge of particles to detect them, so if dark matter has no charge like mentioned in the video, they would not be caught by any ordinary means. Something else must be holding them together then, and as our understanding of physics evolves, researchers have found that electromagnetic fields and gravity work in ways that are nearly mathematically identical. It is entirely possible that the primary source holding dark matter particles together is gravity instead of electromagnetism, which could also explain why these illusive pieces of mass seem to hold unique gravitational properties.",view comment

Inner space has less force when expanded but the space in between now has more influence. An object wants to take the path of least resistance and when it encounters this area in space,it follows this path. It gradually comes under the influence of the space condenced by mass.

I love your videos and your explanations because you don't offer just one explanation. You show the others and explain why they fall short.
However, something doesn't quite add up with the idea of dark matter for me and raises a question.

We know definitively that planetary systems exist within galaxies.
 
If Dark Matter does as well and is also responsible for the rotational curve of galaxies, then why do planetary systems not exhibit the same rotational curve?

Wouldn't dark matter also have the same effect on them?

Perhaps I'm missing something here but it just seems illogical to me that dark matter (if it exists at all) would be so prolific that it could manipulate the rotational curve of an entire galaxy which is comprised of millions of stars and the planetary systems that orbit them.
Yet, at the same time, it wouldn't have the same effect on the planetary systems themselves?

I know the theory claims that this is due to the localized density of a planetary system and because of this dark matter would be diffused.
But that kind of defies logic and this them means that the theory directly contradicts itself because if dark matter passes right through everything and doesn't interact with it then why would it concern itself with local densities? 
More importantly how can something that doesn't interact with anything including itself cluster in the first place?

This problem just has me really scratching my head regarding this subject matter.",view comment

80,,@MrConstitutionDay,23/02/24 19:01:18,0,no,no,"Dark matter need not stay  a mystery. The idea is that dark matter is old and slow and unreactive to light and massive. It can't be found easily.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

part 2
Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

96,,@tjlegs6621,31/03/24 04:03:54,0,no,no,"We can only see patterns. Looking for dark matter in terms of thinking you'll find some patterns is exactly why you can't ever see it. It has no form, no pattern to it. It's formless and void of all patterning, except for a little disturbance in it - Our entire universe.

Even our material universe is not what it appears to you. All you're doing is recognizing the patterns that formless energy is making. Like the whirlpool in a river is just a pattern the flow of water is making. There's no such thing as a whirlpool, really. Same goes for everything else in our universe. Material, matter, isn't really there at all. None of it.

Dark matter is right there in front of your eyes, but you don't see it. That's what something with no form at all looks like. There you go, mystery solved. You won't find it in terms of form. We rely 100% on recognition of forms and patterns to see anything and everything. It's not invisible really, that's simply what something looks like that has no form or pattern. It's anti-form, if you will.

That's the state of the universe you know and see before the big bang, or big expansion. Formless, void. And formless and patternless appears to us as nothing, but it's not nothing. A little disturbance occurred in that formless void, which is still there by the way, that set off a little bit of patterning, and gave birth to form, and voila our known universe was here. But the pre-universe stuff is still there, and you call it the mysterious dark energy. It's no mystery at all. What is it then? Well, it's ""that"". Even asking the question what is it, is silly. Like asking what happened a millisecond before the big bang is a silly question. Nothing happened, and there was no millisecond before.

Furthermore, you'll never find the basic stuff that material is made of, because you can only see patterns. The basic stuff, no matter how powerful of a microscope you may invent, will never find it. Because it's simply not there. It will infinitely escape your observation because you're looking for forms and patterns, of course you are, because that's all we can see or detect. We're patterns looking only for other patterns. And to us patterns, something void and without pattern, appears to us as nothing. And correctly so, it is nothing. But nothing is something.

Same if you try to observe the macroscopic, it will infinitely escape your observation in the same way as the microscopic does. The only way for us to observe the macroscopic though, is in the imagination of the mind. And yes, it escapes our observation in the imagination also.",view comment
