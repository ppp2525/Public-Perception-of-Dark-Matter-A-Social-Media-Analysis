7,,@michaelkahn8744,20/11/22 02:32:28,0,no,no,"There's no Dark Matter. There's no Dark Energy either.
Einstein’s theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.

However, we also observe gravitational effects – curvature of spacetime – in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed – it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now – why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?

The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system – 3 angular coordinates, ?1,  ?2,  ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.

The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubble’s surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local “mountains” and “valleys” on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of “dark matter”.

“Valleys” in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So “dark matter” is really “valleys” in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies – regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, “mountains” in spacetime will repel matter away, an “anti-gravitational” effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.

Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The “missing” energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.

As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the “circumference” of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted. – Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy",view comment

21,,@TomHendricksMusea,02/03/23 01:42:09,0,no,no,"Dark matter suggests something is wrong with our understanding of gravity.  But it also may support my ideas that Dark Energy,  Anti Gravity  is the force.
The force that pushes behind mass to move it forward, and the force in front that resists its acceleration and causes it to have mass.
Gravity = Acceleration?

Does the Earth PULL the APPLE to the ground or
Does the Sky PUSH the APPLE to the ground?
 
Which is correct:  GRAVITY is pulling matter together or ANTI GRAVITY, another name for DARK ENERGY, is pushing it together?  
Which is correct:  GRAVITY, is inside MATTER somewhere, or ANTI GRAVITY is outside everywhere in empty SPACE?   

DARK ENERGY in physics is defined as a repulsive force that counteracts gravity and causes the universe to expand everywhere at an accelerating rate.  My suggestion is that DARK ENERGY is ANTI GRAVITY.  
Most likely it is ZERO POINT ENERGY, The  COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT and VIRTUAL PARTICLES too.

My next suggestion is that  THERE IS NO GRAVITY!  

My idea is similar to a universe wide CASIMIR EFFECT on all matter. Here, instead of two metal plates being pushed together, there are ""plates"" of matter and the expanding space around them, pushing them together. 

Dr Einstein said his breakthrough came when he imagined an analogy of an elevator in space.  As acceleration increases, gravity increases.  The person in the elevator can't tell if he is in an elevator traveling in space or one on Earth.  
BUT WHAT IF WE ARE BOTH RIGHT.

Look at the drawing.


There are two round elevators.  

The elevator on the left IS NOT  accelerating.
No acceleration = No gravity
The force of empty space or anti gravity,  pushes on all sides equally.  

The elevator on the right IS accelerating.
Acceleration  = Gravity.
The force of empty space or anti gravity,  pushes on all sides, but mostly from the front due to acceleration!  The acceleration scrunches up the forces in front. They overlap each other from the elevator accelerating into them.  These cumulative, empty space, forces, push back more and more as the elevator accelerates in that forward direction.
This causes gravity. Acceleration = Gravity!

More exactly the forces of ANTI GRAVITY cause matter to experience what we call gravity.

So: acceleration of an object in space causes space to push back. This is what we have been calling gravity but is anti gravity.

Some will say:
But it's so obvious, the Sun goes around the Earth, and the apple falls to the ground.
Yes they seem obvious.  But both are wrong!

My previous posts, part of a single paper covering all these ideas, suggested that before the Big Bang, there  was a singularity of photons, an eternal dimensionless point of energy.
Then the force that expanded out of the Big Bang and started the universe, and time space, was DARK ENERGY; a subset of the singularity of photons.

So Gravity from stars and planets was never PULLING matter together.  The opposite was true: Anti Gravity or DARK ENERGY from empty space was expanding and PUSHING matter together from all sides! 

THERE IS NO GRAVITY pulling anything together.   THERE IS ONLY ANTI GRAVITY or DARK ENERGY expanding and pushing matter on all sides. This can explain acceleration in elevators, rocket propulsion; the rubber sheet analogy, why no light escapes black holes, space expansion, curvature of space, and why there is so little gravity in the quantum world.

...
Three Follow Ups.

1. Remember the rubber sheet analogy? The rubber sheet is space pushing on all sides. That's the force I'm talking about that causes what we call gravity.
Q. The implication is clear (or at least, it was clear to Einstein): Gravity causes acceleration, and acceleration causes gravity. They are absolutely identical

2. Galileo's experiment, later recreated on the moon shows a hammer and feather dropping and hitting the ground at the same time. This supports space pushing them , not the attraction of their weight.

3. Doppler Effect: Waves emitted by a source traveling towards an observer get compressed. 

4. The greatest force in the universe is dark energy,  the energy of empty space.  Dark energy is 70% of all energy. It has such force that its expanding the universe  everywhere  all the time, and is now speeding up.

5. Dark matter suggests that we need a different theory of gravity.  Dark energy or anti gravity  would explain both as the force from empty space pushing matter forward, and the force in front of matter resisting its acceleration and giving it mass.",view comment

Dark Matter then is a wavelength not as long as Dark Energy.  But CIG Theory still needs a more direct link to the reality of the electromagnetic spectrum in the context that the spectrum proceeds at ""c"". Are we sure it always proceeds at ""c""? Maxwell made this link yes, but in CIG, the ""c"" portion of the spectrum is reserved for Dark Energy, while the lesser rates = more solid forms of matter. Quantum Gravity appears resolved in CIG. But this aspect of melting CIG into the spectrum because of the consistency of the spectrum to travel at ""c"" confuses me. Any help would be appreciated. CIG resolves so many quantum and cosmological conundrums. We know it is correct. While inherent to CIG is the link between Dark Matter and Dark Energy, the direct reference to Dark Matter waves was absorbed from Dr. Lisanti's Simon Foundation video on Dark Matter. She is amazing. The offering then is that we extend the wavelength to Dark Energy which is much much longer than even Dark Matter. The MTS equation links Black Holes to Dark Energy.

32,,@douglasking9383,13/05/23 23:58:04,0,no,no,", there is no dark matter! It exists as a result of scientists fundamental misunderstanding of the comparison of the configurations of a solar system and a galaxy. You say they are the same but there are not. The solar system is like a system of balls orbiting around a central ball. Gravity holds the solar system in that particular configuration. The result is the inner balls orbit more quickly than the outer balls. Then you made the mistake of visualizing the galaxies as a similar system of balls orbiting around a central point. That is, in fact, not the case at all. Have you ever heard of an amusement park ride called The Octopus? It’s an attraction that has several seats located along the tentacles of the 'octopus' that radiate outward. The patrons sit on the seats which are flung around on these tentacles at speed. The thing about this ride is it resembles very closely how spinning galaxies look face on. Gravity, in the case of the galaxies, holds the stars in a similar manner to seats on our Octopus. Gravity binds the stars within chains of fellow stars that radiate out of the central point of the galaxy, like tentacles of an octopus. That's the galaxy's configuration, which is different from that of the solar system. You may observe that the Octopus tentacles orbit the centre at a constant speed so that the inner seats move at the same speed as the outer seats. Now imagine that the tentacles of our amusement park Octopus are flexible so that the outer seats are whipped out at a greater speed than the inner seats. This is exactly what we see with galaxies, the outer stars are moving faster than the inner stars because of this whipping effect. Nowhere in my explanation does it require the existence of so-called ""dark matter"". 

If we picture the Universe as a spiral, not too dissimilar to a galaxy where the 'stars' are galaxies, then the red shift is just an indication of the furthest galaxies being whipped about like the arms of the galaxies. No dark matter needed. The existence of dark energy can be explained by substituting dark matter in its place. Unless you can provide an example that can be explained with dark energy exclusively, I don't see the need for dark energy at all. I hate to say it, but you scientists have been so buried in your formulas that you can't see the simple solutions that are staring you right in the face.",view comment

I know this may not sit well with physicists but I would like to present a very limited understanding of Buddhist cosmology because this presentation takes into account both the physical realms of the universe and non-physical realms of consciousness and may shed some inkling of insight into the ""matter."" 

Just as there are multiple planes or levels of consciousness that we can experience correspondingly, according to Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple planes in which consciousness can reside. Ths most subtle being the ""Formless realm"" where, as the name implies, there is no physical form yet consciousness resides. This is followed by the ""Form realm"", which does contain a subtle physical form, and then the ""desire realm"" where we are. To add to the complexity of this, there are multiple planes of existence within each of these realms in which beings, whose number, like the universe, is infinite, reside according to the karmic relationship of the cause-and-effect nature of consciousness and matter. 

Now for the relationship to the unfolding of cosmic inflation and the big bang. It is said that our universe, being one of infinite, is formed in stages from elements going from subtle to gross; begining with ""wind"" and settling into ""earth."" The ""winds"" churning, or power, or formation, is dependent on and has a direct relationship with consciousnesses in the formless realm. This wind, in turn,  creates fire, creating water, and then finally earth. Where t=0 in the formation of the universe only ""winds,"" and likewise formless beings,  were present driving inflation and evolution of the universe to the point where conditions for each successive element to form; the very hot dense beginning being fire, then water, then stars and planets corresponding to the element of earth. Each stage, likewise, becomes the physical conditions needed for the individual consciousness from the various realms to reside; as the universe formation evolves so too do its conscious inhabitants.

SO what is dark matter and energy?

I propose, and i am just saying this to spark imagination and possibility:

Dark matter = The beings residing on other planes in the universe that we are not able to (and my never be able to) detect 

Dark energy = The forces and interrelationship of matter and consciousness of the various beings that reside within the universe",view comment

79,,@MrConstitutionDay,15/02/24 03:55:01,0,no,no,"The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",view comment
