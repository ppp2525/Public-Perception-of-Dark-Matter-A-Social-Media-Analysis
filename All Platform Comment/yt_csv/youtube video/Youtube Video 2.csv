00:00 ?? *La materia que conocemos, como átomos, estrellas, planetas y demás, representa menos del 5% del universo conocido. El 25% es materia oscura y el 70% es energía oscura, ambas invisibles, lo que sugiere que nuestra experiencia es solo una fracción mínima de la realidad.*
00:29 ?? *La materia oscura es crucial para la existencia de galaxias, ya que la cantidad de materia visible no es suficiente para formarlas debido a la gravedad. Aunque no la vemos directamente, su presencia se evidencia por la forma en que interactúa con la luz.*
01:33 ?? *Sobre la materia oscura, solo sabemos tres cosas seguras: existe algo allí, interactúa con la gravedad y hay una gran cantidad de ello. Probablemente esté compuesta por partículas exóticas que no interactúan con la luz y la materia como esperamos.*
02:29 ?? *La energía oscura es aún más misteriosa. No podemos detectarla directamente ni medirla, pero observamos claramente sus efectos. Su existencia se infiere por la aceleración de la expansión del universo, contrariamente a la creencia de que la gravedad lo frenaría.*
03:26 ?? *La energía oscura parece ser una propiedad intrínseca del espacio vacío, más potente que cualquier otra energía conocida. A medida que pasa el tiempo, esta energía se fortalece, llenando constantemente el espacio vacío con más energía que todo lo demás en el universo combinado.*
04:50 ?? *Las teorías sobre la energía oscura incluyen la posibilidad de que sea una propiedad del espacio o que provenga de partículas virtuales temporales. También se plantea la idea de un tipo desconocido de energía dinámica con un efecto opuesto al de la energía y materia normales, pero aún no se sabe cómo detectarla ni dónde encontrarla.*
05:45 ?? *Aunque desconocemos gran parte de la materia y energía que componen el universo, esto representa un emocionante desafío científico.

14,,@BrianCStratton,08/12/23 21:01:57,0,no,no,"I would like to begin admitting I am an ignorant human but nonetheless very curiuos as well.

I know this may not sit well with physicists but I would like to present a very limited understanding of Buddhist cosmology because this presentation takes into account both the physical realms of the universe and non-physical realms of consciousness and may shed some inkling of insight into the ""matter."" 

Just as there are multiple planes or levels of consciousness that we can experience correspondingly, according to Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple planes in which consciousness can reside. Ths most subtle being the ""Formless realm"" where, as the name implies, there is no physical form yet consciousness resides. This is followed by the ""Form realm"", which does contain a subtle physical form, and then the ""desire realm"" where we are. To add to the complexity of this, there are multiple planes of existence within each of these realms in which beings, whose number, like the universe, is infinite, reside according to the karmic relationship of the cause-and-effect nature of consciousness and matter. 

Now for the relationship to the unfolding of cosmic inflation and the big bang. It is said that our universe, being one of infinite, is formed in stages from elements going from subtle to gross; begining with ""wind"" and settling into ""earth."" The ""winds"" churning, or power, or formation, is dependent on and has a direct relationship with consciousnesses in the formless realm. This wind, in turn,  creates fire, creating water, and then finally earth. Where t=0 in the formation of the universe only ""winds,"" and likewise formless beings,  were present driving inflation and evolution of the universe to the point where conditions for each successive element to form; the very hot dense beginning being fire, then water, then stars and planets corresponding to the element of earth. Each stage, likewise, becomes the physical conditions needed for the individual consciousness from the various realms to reside; as the universe formation evolves so too do its conscious inhabitants.

SO what is dark matter and energy?

I propose, and i am just saying this to spark imagination and possibility:

Dark matter = The beings residing on other planes in the universe that we are not able to (and my never be able to) detect 

Dark energy = The forces and interrelationship of matter and consciousness of the various beings that reside within the universe",view comment

They came up with dark matter, which creates additional gravity and allows galaxies to rotate so quickly.
But they can't find this dark matter.
What if there is no dark matter?
Maybe there another interaction of matter on large scales?
Weaker than gravity, but even longer-range. Let's say its strength decreases not as the square of the distance, but less.
Because of this, on a small scale, such as the solar system, its influence is imperceptible due to its insignificant micropower.
But on the scale of galaxies, over many tens of light years, this force is more powerful than gravity due to a more significant weakening of the gravitational force.
Following the example of strong and weak nuclear interaction: there can also be strong and weak gravitational interaction.
This could explain why galaxies rotate faster than gravity allows.",view comment

59,,@MrConstitutionDay,15/02/24 05:12:28,0,no,no,"The dark matter model is strange.
It is strongly connected to the quarks of the standard model of particle physics.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",view comment

We constantly describe reality around us according to our own eyes, but this is flawed understanding because God was, is the only eternal entity there is and anything else including the darkness of space, and shadows are created  from nothing, which is what creating means. Meaning the shadows we see, the darkness that is in space were not originally there and ""not eternal"" to begin with. Therefore we cannot say the space and darkness is nothing and we cannot say it is being created ""by"" nothing rather ""from"" nothing.

This verse about the reality of shadows God exactly mentioned after talking about how people depend solely on their minds to be guided about the meaning of life to tell you that, just like the empirically untouchable shadows, your thought process is also invisible to you but it is still a non-eternal thing that was created and unless you follow the word of God which is revealed to humans by prophets completely as is and unchanged ""the pure word of the lord"", you cannot be guided. 

Bottom line is, you cannot depend on a created thing to be guided to the uncreated ""God"" because you will constantly fall victim to the whims of the relativity of the human mind. (just like they though that the shadow is the absence of light when darkness is really a created thing that covers everything and expands and contracts in synchrony with light).
