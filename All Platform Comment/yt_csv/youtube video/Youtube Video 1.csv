So the Big Bang assumption is what causes us to have dark energy and mass, which is a misconception.",UCNoM2TK24I630s0l86yGuAQ,UgynEg-Auq_xVLJ79Qt4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HneiEA1B8ks&lc=UgynEg-Auq_xVLJ79Qt4AaABAg

Dark matter melts into time and expands the space of Universe, it bends light at denser points, yet only detectable by its effect on observer and is always untouchable and unfathomable like time.

When velocity of an object increases, dark matter acts thicker to it like ice,  rather than liquid, and melts slowly. Hence time dilation in relativity 

Just like when a spacecraft re-enters earths atmosphere, it feels air thicker than it normally does at lower speeds

A wormhole is the absence of dark matter due to excessive melting and it consumes lots of energy to maintain it.

Dark matter touches almost everything observable, hence information is passed on between entangled particles

Dark matter limits the speed of light. Speeds higher than C is also possible in the absence of Dark matter (Eg. inside Wormhole)

Gravity thickens Dark Matter. It melts slowly near the source of gravity and melts faster into time when away from the source of gravity

It exists as a result of scientists fundamental misunderstanding of the comparison of the configurations of a solar system and a galaxy. You say they are the same but there are not. The solar system is like a system of balls orbiting around a central ball. Gravity holds the solar system in that particular configuration. The result is the inner balls orbit more quickly than the outer balls. Then you made the mistake of visualizing the galaxies as a similar system of balls orbiting around a central point. That is, in fact, not the case at all. Have you ever heard of an amusement park ride called The Octopus? It’s an attraction that has several seats located along the tentacles of the 'octopus' that radiate outward. The patrons sit on the seats which are flung around on these tentacles at speed. The thing about this ride is it resembles very closely how spinning galaxies look face on. Gravity, in the case of the galaxies, holds the stars in a similar manner to seats on our Octopus. Gravity binds the stars within chains of fellow stars that radiate out of the central point of the galaxy, like tentacles of an octopus. That's the galaxy's configuration, which is different from that of the solar system. You may observe that the Octopus tentacles orbit the centre at a constant speed so that the inner seats move at the same speed as the outer seats. Now imagine that the tentacles of our amusement park Octopus are flexible so that the outer seats are whipped out at a greater speed than the inner seats. This is exactly what we see with galaxies, the outer stars are moving faster than the inner stars because of this whipping effect. Nowhere in my explanation does it require the existence of so-called ""dark matter"". 

If we picture the Universe as a spiral, not too dissimilar to a galaxy where the 'stars' are galaxies, then the red shift is just an indication of the furthest galaxies being whipped about like the arms of the galaxies. No dark matter needed. The existence of dark energy can be explained by substituting dark matter in its place.

I agree to that idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.
But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.
That's because gravity is not a force.
Gravity is just a joint effect of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.
Details are given below.

Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einstein’s theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects – curvature of spacetime – in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed – it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now – why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system – 3 angular coordinates, φ1, φ2, φ3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubble’s surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local “mountains” and “valleys” on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of “dark matter”. “Valleys” in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So “dark matter” is really “valleys” in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies – regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, “mountains” in spacetime will repel matter away, an “anti-gravitational” effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The “missing” energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the “circumference” of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2π light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*〖10〗^6 km⁄s)/(2π*4233Mpc)=(1.88*〖10〗^6 km⁄s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km⁄s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.
