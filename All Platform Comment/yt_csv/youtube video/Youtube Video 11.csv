10,,@hudsonbakke8836,21/11/23 04:41:44,0,no,no,"In my opinion, as someone who isn't a physicist but just someone who studies and appreciates physics, what we call ""dark matter"" isn't a thing at all. It's a name we give to something that can account for the errors in our calculations based on the relativistic model of the universe. It could be a real, physical substance, however I personally think it's far more likely that ""dark matter"" simply arises in our calculations due to a fundamental incompleteness in our mathematical model of gravity. This is exactly what lead to the development of general relativity in the first place—for centuries people used Newton's law of gravitation because it was perfect at describing gravitation at a small scale, however as people began peering more and more into the cosmos, and trying to use Newton's law to predict the motion of celestial bodies, they began to realize that there was always a small but significant error in their calculations, and that's when Einstein created general relativity as a mathematical framework to correct for that error and make better predictions about the motion of planets and stars. I think what we are discovering with ""dark matter"" is the same thing that Einstein discovered when analyzing the orbit of Mercury. The current mathematical model we have is really really good, practically indistinguishable from perfect for predictions on the scale of solar systems, however when you scale up to an entire galaxy, that model becomes more and more inaccurate and we will need a new model to correct for that error. Importantly, Einstein did not ""disprove"" Newton when he invented general relativity. Newton's law of gravitation becomes more and more accurate the smaller and smaller scale you measure across. All Einstein did was show that Newton's law, while correct in a way, was just incomplete, and generalized it to a much larger context. In the same way, I don't think dark matter disproves relativity. Rather, relativity is a model that becomes more and more accurate on smaller and smaller scales, and it's not that it's *wrong* on larger scales per se; it's just incomplete. Maybe some future mathematician and physicist will come up with a new model to generalize relativity to the scale of entire galaxies, thus obsoleting the concept of dark matter entirely.",view comment

12,,@JKDVIPER,23/11/23 14:06:05,0,no,no,"We don’t need DARK MATTER. I’ve got it. Galaxy’s stay together not from gravity alone. First off, we still cannot point to a wave, a vibe, a particle, anything to ascribe something substantive to what gravity is. I’ve heard theories, Einstein was probably the closest to reality of anybody. But even if we understand gravity, who says that’s the only thing holding it together? A SPACE STORM. Think about it. If atoms in gas here on earth can be so highly energized, as to cause a hurricane, a tornado, and that’s just hot and cold gas. Not very dense. Not much power when compared to higher pressure higher temperature matter in deep space. A cold dense center like a supermassive black hole surrounded by a gaseous star matter swirling around it sounds like a SPACE STORM to me. Our missing matter (MASS) hypothesized is really and truly ENERGY. Still equivalent. A storm produces FORCE. That galaxy holds together by thermodynamics.  That’s my idea. We don’t need EXTRA MASS when we have tons of uncounted ENERGY. That’s the missing link. A galaxy is a SPACE HURRICANE bud.”",view comment
13,,@JKDVIPER,23/11/23 14:14:08,0,no,no,"My second idea is this. Matter is probably causing the expansion. Displacement of empty space, (the cosmological constant) means space has to curve around objects. If we sink a beach ball or hundreds of them in a pool. It will raise the volume by displacement. Stars, especially black holes lock out empty space and stop time, if we freeze a piece of steak it saves it longer. TIME. Black holes cores are absolute zero. Time stops. That’s a cancer, a growth to space. A beach ball sunken in a pool. That would blow out our edge with trillions of galaxies possible.",view comment
14,,@JKDVIPER,23/11/23 14:19:26,0,no,no,"Gravity is problematic for us. It probably comes from the movements of our planet sun and galaxy. Those corkscrew actions we take.

In actuality we’re covering WAY MORE GROUND than we think. So our little circular motions are stretched out over giant lengths of empty space.” Thats gravity. You’re in a car that’s going 70,000 MPH around a FLYING NUKE. ??so even if you manage to get off the planet with force from oxygen and hydrogen, you are still flying the same speed as the car.

Einstein formulated an improved theory of gravity.  It works for all practical applications of our time.

82,,@MrConstitutionDay,22/02/24 19:16:30,1,no,no,"Dark matter in small quantities starts the production of planets and stars. Entire stars made only of dark matter are rare. Nearly every star has a lot of dark matter at its center. Discovery of dark matter will be soon. 
It depends on the speed of space exploration and development.

The evidence of dark matter is overwhelming. Sadly the evidence for the standard model particle of dark matter is completely lacking. Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.

Ok. So the Chrysanthemum or Mum, sometimes called the Mon when depicted in art,  can now be understood in terms of highly temporary but sometimes long lived quark models.
It is sometimes well established that early versions of the mum were constricted within 2 dimensions. They were strongly limited, apparently limited to about 21 petals, as predicted by Fibonnacci. However, in later Mon depictions, full blown 3 dimensional mums have been depicted and are apparently grown and are flourishing. These are much larger than previous 2 dimensional models.
In counterpart, quark models in the standard model have far exceeded the dark matter models contemplated. For instance, Charm quarks are over 600 times larger than standard Up quarks, and Bottom quarks are over 400 times bigger than standard Strange quarks.
In previous models of the Fibonacci model of quark expansion, the numbers (10^2 to 10^5) are well known and within the known potential of this dimension of dark matter.
We can expect this dimension of dark matter stable components within isolated dark matter, such as within isolated galactic halos. However, trapped dark matter components such as within stars, planets and moons may be decaying quickly, as exhibited by our own Moon, which has shut down and become locked in its gravitationally stabilized orbit, and the planets Mercury and perhaps even Mars, which apparently have also slowed down, and headed for stopping. This energetic model is shocking, and further dark matter and similar quark models, may be decaying or already gone, so the Mum/Mon model will be an important strategic exploration and investigation. 
I like the Chrysanthemum model for quarks anyway. It depicts the exponential growth of standard model quarks that we have already seen. However, I think we will see a plateauing of such quark expansions, I think the upper limit of further discoveries such as within the Cern Large Hadron Collider may be reached at about 10,000 times the mass of standard model Up quarks.
Spoiler Alert: There may be some new quarks within this range. However, some dimensions or ranges of dark matter quarks may already have expired and would only be available at galactic scales of discovery and investigation.
So dark matter research may still have local frontiers to discover, but may stall at this range. 
The good news is that we have an extremely long time to do this  research and discovery of standard model quarks before dark energy expansion catches up with us. 
Relax. It's cool.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Fibonacci mathematical Chrysanthemum experiment in both quarks and dark matter. 
Thank you for reading.
 

part 3

Ok. So we are now assuming the Fibonnacci based Chrysanthemum model of hyperdimensional dark matter and quarks. 
Or we still have sluggards or Luddites who can't keep up.
In this assumptive model, this structure suggests that such matter would be in the range of 10^5 to 10^8 times the mass of standard model quarks. For regular folks this is from 10,000 times to 100,000,000 times this mass.
That is really close to the neutron star category of matter.
While this may be amusing consider where this is going, the next phase of dark matter and as yet undiscovered quark masses would have to be in the range of 10^13 to 10^21, or 1,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 quark masses. Is this in the range of black holes yet? Or are we still stalled at very large neutron stars? Again we must pause and consider where we are.
The first stages of dark matter is from 10^2 to 10^3 masses, the 2nd stage would be from 10^3 to 10^5 masses, the 3rd stage would be from 10^5 to 10^8 masses, and the 4th stage would be from 10^8 masses to 10^13 masses. Whew. Theoretically the 5th stage of dark matter would be 10^13 to 10^21 masses. That still leaves us with the 6th stage of the mass of dark matter and quarks. This is the staggering number of 10^21 to 10^34 masses for quarks and dark matter. Wow. This is clearly the end of our Chrysanthemum dark matter models. It is also the end of our hierarchical mass models. What comes after the end of our Electromagnetism model? I dare not postulate. But I suspect outer space models of dark energy. This is the incredible range of from 10^34 to 10^55 masses, a gut wrenching number
 times the mass of standard  model quarks. 
This is the amount of masses that represents the beginning or the ending of the universe.
It's not just a black hole.
It's the end.

Not far away orbits a Neutron star not that far removed in mass from becoming a black hole. 
How likely is that gravitational energy as a blob of mass is absorbed (???) into the neutron star and in effect is pushed into becoming a black hole.
