1,,@shawns0762,15/04/24 23:58:14,0,no,no,"General Relativity predicts dilation, not singularities. Dilation explains dark matter. In the 1939 journal ""Annals of Mathematics"" he wrote -
    ""The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the Schwarzchild singularities (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General Relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters (star clusters) whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The Schwarzchild singularities do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light""
   He was referring to the phenomenon of dilation (sometimes called gamma or y) mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. It's the phenomenon behind the phrase ""mass becomes infinite at the speed of light"". Time dilation is one aspect of dilation, it's not just time that gets dilated. A graph illustrates its squared nature, dilation increases at an exponential rate the closer you get to the speed of light.
   Dilation will occur wherever there is an astronomical quantity of mass because high mass means high momentum. It's the original, correct explanation for why we cannot see light from the galactic center.
   There is no singularity at the center of our galaxy. It can be inferred mathematically that dilation is occurring there. This means that there is no valid XYZ coordinate we can attribute to it, you can't point your finger at something that is smeared through spacetime. More precisely, everywhere you point is equally valid. In other words that mass is all around us. This is the explanation for galaxy rotation curves, the ""missing mass"" is dilated mass.
   Dilation does not occur in galaxies with low mass centers because they do not have enough mass to achieve relativistic velocities. It has recently been confirmed in 6 very, very low mass galaxies including NGC 1052-DF2 and DF4 to show no signs of dark matter. This also explains why all planets and all binary stars have normal rotation rates, not 3 times normal.
   Singularities were popularized by television and movies beginning in the 1960's. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that they cannot exist. Nobody believed in them when he was alive including Plank, Bohr, Schrodinger, Dirac, Heisenberg, Feynman etc.",view comment
2,,@eternisedDragon7,16/04/24 06:09:32,0,no,no,"As the world's leading dark matter scientist who solved the mystery on dark matter and dark energy, I can with overwhelming amount of evidential observational and argumentative supporting materials (namely 50+ qualitatively different ones) assert you that it's dark matter and not random walks of space-time. In particular, it is dark matter composed of exactly 6 different particles if one includes the anti-matter of dark matter (which is still dark matter), and otherwise it is just the electron neutrino, the muon neutrino, and the tauon neutrino, because the known neutrinos are all of dark matter and explain the cosmic web based dynamical dark energy mechanism, too.",view comment
3,,@mikecavedon8629,16/04/24 13:00:25,0,no,no,"Dark matter is the fabric of spacetime. Dark matter is displaced by ordinary matter. Displaced dark matter is the physical manifestation of curved spacetime.

Spacetime is a mathematical construct only. It's not physically real in and of itself. Curved spacetime is a geometrical representation of gravity, not a physical one.

Dark matter fills the vacuum of space and is displaced by ordinary matter. What is referred to geometrically as curved spacetime physically exists as displaced dark matter.

Displaced dark matter 'displaces back', causing gravity.",view comment
