7,,@jayb5596,"2023-06-16 00:25:36",0,no,no,"E = mc2. It's the world's most famous equation, but what does it really mean? ""Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared."" On the most basic level, the equation says that energy and mass (matter) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing.

I have a computer which draws 230w of energy and the monitor draws 43w of power. 230/43 = 5.348837209302326 gives us our power ratio.

In this system the systems hardware is consuming 5.3x more energy than the display device of the system.

This correlates with Dark Matter and Ordinary matter.

26.8/4.9=5.469387755102041 that gives us our dark matter to ordinary matter energy ratio which is quite comparable to my system example above.

In this example we will break down.

Dark Matter 26.8%
Ordinary Matter 4.9%

Dark matter is just matter that isn't seen. We know its there but we can't see/detect it other than indirectly by its affect on the matter we do see or detect.
That's not really a mystery. I don't understand why people want to make it a mystery. Space is not empty. Asteroids, Meteors, the Oort cloud, interstellar debris.
Dark matter...until it isn't.
Matter releases energy. It decays, it evaporates, it reacts, it sublimates, it does a bunch of other things as it changes from being matter or to other forms of matter.
We can't see this going on out in the void of space.
Its dark.
I think of it as a massive stagnant pool with a dusting of talc sitting on it's surface in the center.
Place a single drop of soap at its center.
It expands.

They love to dissect everything in the to study it. From a frog, to atoms, planets to galaxies. But they’re still looking from the outside in. Which means they will always be on the outside looking in know matter how much they study matter on its smallest or grandest scales.

Then both groups are ask the question. What is an amusement part

The physicist will describe their experience of it and be excited about how much they learned about the mechanical workings of it, but there’s still much more to learn to complete the experience.

The child will say it’s a place where you go to have fun in so many different and exciting ways. You also leave there happy not worried about anything feeling full and satisfied.

This  makes a case for anti gravity, not gravity, as the force that comes from acceleration.

Einstein recognized that acceleration was equivalent to the force of gravity. He said that this was the happiest thought of his life.

Had he known that 95% of the universe was not matter but Dark Energy and Dark Matter, he would have recognized that acceleration  was the equivalent to the force of ANTI GRAVITY.
He would have seen that it wasn't gravity from matter; but anti gravity from empty space  that was the force.

The diagram shows how dark energy and dark matter from empty space push back more and more against matter as it accelerates.

Top, the globe has no acceleration. 
Next picture, there is some acceleration and  the arrows show resistance from empty space as the globe moves forward.
Finally as the globe  approaches the speed of light, the resistance from empty space becomes massive and approaches infinite.
No matter can travel at the speed of light.

DARK ENERGY;  Dark energy is energy that expands. In every part of the universe. It acts like anti gravity and is associated with the vacuum of space.  My Suggestion is that this is a force of anti gravity expansion.

DARK MATTER ;  Dark matter is labeled as a gravitational pull.  Yet there are no baryons - no matter - that's been found to do the pulling. Many physicists are looking for the missing matter.  My suggestion is the obvious - it's not there!  The force is anti gravity that we know is there.  That means dark energy and dark matter are the same thing.  They are both antigravity.

Together dark energy and dark matter, or both together as anti gravity, represent 95% of the universe and they represent a single expansion force everywhere.  Finally this may well be the same force that began with the Big Bang expansion,

Here is a diagram showing  the make up of the universe.
95% anti gravity (dark energy + dark matter) and 
5%  hydrogen and helium gas, stars, neutrinos, and all other atoms combined.

ANTIGRAVITY 95%               STARS, ETC. 5%

 Here's some support.  There is a cosmological redshift that comes from the expansion of space itself. The galaxies are not moving, but the intervening space is stretching.

What is dark energy in simple terms?

Think of dark energy as the ""evil counterpart"" to gravity–an ""anti-gravity"" force providing a negative pressure that fills the universe and stretches the very fabric of spacetime. As it does so dark energy drives cosmic objects apart at an increasingly rapid rate rather than drawing them together as gravity does.Nov 24, 2022

Here's the problem. Dark Matter has been around for far longer than standard model particles. Since they are so old and slow moving and neutral and massive they are not found just anywhere. In fact they tend to be found only at the centers of large massive objects like stars and planets and moons and the like. Otherwise, they are found in the halos of galaxies. The exception would seem to be large massive yet fragmented objects, such as the asteroid belt protoplanet between Mars and Jupiter. The masses of dark matter particles may well have several varieties from the least massive and youngest to the most massive and oldest. The least massive and youngest may well fall into the logarithmic scale proportional to that between Gravity and Electromagnetism. This is the hierarchical scale with Hadronic and Leptonic quarks at one end, the bottom end of this scale. This spans 10^36 in a scale proportional to the relative number of dimensions applying to this scale. Clearly there must be several dimensions in this scale. Approximately 7 dimensions seems to be the least massive divisision of this logarithmic scale that makes any sense. Applying a natural scale suggests that at minimum 1/18 of 36 or about 10^2 times as massive as quarks for the least massive initial stages or types of forms of dark matter, while 1/7 of 36 or about 10^5 or more times as massive as quarks for the most massive forms of the initial stages or types of dark matter. Consequentially, small quantities of this novel form of dark matter should be able to be detected, then found, isolated, formally discovered, transported, refined and manufactured. Obviously research and developments  in the asteroid  belt are going to be instrumental in this discovery. The slow pace of space exploration seems to mean that it's going to be a while before we get this discovery at long last. Of course, the future of dark matter doesn't really begin until its formal discovery, so we'll have to wait till then, whenever that may be.",UCsMzM9sZE-iMhIelfGsuOGg,Ugx_89TBKUWY9tuflLR4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GEZ95TJ5Ao&lc=Ugx_89TBKUWY9tuflLR4AaABAg
