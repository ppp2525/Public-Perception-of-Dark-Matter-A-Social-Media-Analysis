Our observations & senses are limited to physical dimension, reality is universe has more dimension than physical dimension & time-space , true nature of universe is in non physical form , which we could reraly explore ..!  
Even though in ancient scriptures of Hinduism Veda , Puran , Upanishads & Geeta it is mentioned how is universe..! One of verse of Geeta in which Lord Krishna explained his mate Arjuna ..
""I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.""
He was talking about supreme consciousness  (non physical dimension, which has neither beginning nor end , it's just infinite, for eternal times)  , everything is made of from that infinite Consciousness..!

Yes consequentially that universe is further away but the space in between is expanding,view comment
