    This is all based on a slight red color.  Yet our sunset is red...dust and gas cause this and the farther you look into deep space the more dust and gas there is to tint the galaxies red, so naturally all the galaxies appear to be moving away from us.  Yet we know that galaxies swirl in vortexes and orbit each other.   If the fabric of space, or space time, moves around with the rotation of the galaxy then the spin of the galaxy would not produce the centripetal force as it is observed from an outside observer.  There is also time dilation.  How fast are we traveling in relation to a static spot between the galaxies or in relation to light speed?  If we are traveling hundreds of thousands of miles per hour then there is a time dilation in our own world and it makes the outside universe look like it's going faster than it realy is.",view comment

173,,@michaelkahn8744,28/02/23 23:13:53,0,no,no,"There's No Dark Matter. There's No Dark Energy either.

Einstein’s theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation. Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.

However, we also observe gravitational effects – curvature of spacetime – in areas without any detectable mass. This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity. So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed – it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime. In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now – why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?

The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time. Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one. Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system – 3 angular coordinates, ?1,  ?2,  ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t. We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time. Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.

The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions. The expansion rate at one point on the bubble’s surface may differ slightly from another point near it. The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions. The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local “mountains” and “valleys” on the surface of the universe bubble. The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of “dark matter”.

“Valleys” in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects. So “dark matter” is really “valleys” in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it. These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies – regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass. Conversely, “mountains” in spacetime will repel matter away, an “anti-gravitational” effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.

Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface. These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat. This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other. It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating. The “missing” energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy. The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy. Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.

As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model. Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second. Therefore, the “circumference” of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s. This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer. At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc). Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as:

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6  km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close. There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted. – Cited from https://www.academia.edu/82481487/Title_Alternative_Explanation_of_Dark_Matter_and_Dark_Energy",view comment

So basically when u turn on the lights and turn them off again the light is gone and the black energy ""dark matter"" will fill the room ?? times faster than light speed and the whole unseen universe doesnt have any light source which makes dark matter expand infinatly and this dark matter isnt even matter so if u go by any way to the unseen universe u will be stuck there forever as theres no time there same as black holes, but difference is that black holes are matters but dark energy isnt matter.

Thats my thoughts tho and it may not be true ??",view comment
