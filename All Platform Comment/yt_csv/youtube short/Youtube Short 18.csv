5,,@michaelkahn8744,29/05/23 22:05:36,11,no,no,"Alternative Explanation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Newly proposed model of Universe can explain both of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Einstein’s theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects – curvature of spacetime – in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed – it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now – why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system – 3 angular coordinates, ?1, ?2, ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubble’s surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local “mountains” and “valleys” on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of “dark matter”. “Valleys” in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So “dark matter” is really “valleys” in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies – regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, “mountains” in spacetime will repel matter away, an “anti-gravitational” effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The “missing” energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the “circumference” of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 + 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.

I still believe that dark matter is a tunnel we should have never gone down. I have no basis behind this, but I believe in time we will find that our understanding of gravity is incorrect. How can it both be a curvature in spacetime & a force carrying particle? We already have evidence of spacetime curvature through gravitational lensing. I truly believe the Graviton will forever be hypothetical l. Similar to MOND, it may be that we need MOGR (Modified General Relativity)

Also, the subatomic particles of the standard model were predicted decades before they were proven through experimentation. There has never been a reliable theory of dark matter. All we have is, it's a high mass particle that only interacts gravitationally. It's wasn't predicted prior to experimental evidence, it was theorised as a correction for the discrepancy in mass:angular momentum within galaxies because physicists had no explanation. It's not predicted in the standard model or in Einstein's equations",view comment

31,,@jaymethodus3421,15/06/23 15:16:12,0,no,no,"There is no dark matter, these are the remnant cores of the universes first super mega galaxy cluster duster black holes. They were “relatively” poofy globulous “puddles” of dense dipole pair soup. a state of Proto-crystalline hyper-realness; I.e the probabilistic distribution functions of all potential values of energy converge on a specific point within determinable “range”of probabilities, as far as the EH perimeter, where this dipole proto hyper real soup stuff starts shooting off protons and negative mass anti electrons in “opposite directions”. Protons “decay” into neutrons and high energy antipair virtual particles that collapse and annihilate cyclically releasing energy as EM “waves”. The neutrons are short lived and the energy of EM wave releases, is enough over pressure energy to break them back into - and + pairs. The first hydrogen atoms in the universe. After this process, a “solid” mass of neutral heavy particles in hyper-real probability lock relative to eachother(the particles are still technically “infinite heat” and can not be “jostled” from their energy states until the heat death of the universe basically), is leftover- inside the infinity contained within the singularity, with almost no mass, but still technically an “infinite” energy binding the remaining mass to that point.

The remaining cores are a new state of matter that have mass contained in an infinity-rest equilibrium state while in “cold” space; meaning almost no external energy pressures; without affecting local gravity vectors at all, but still affected BY the overall gravity vectors of other matter. This state of matter conserves Energy in an easier way than “bending space time”. I believe at absolute rest, it simply emits what can only be thought about as “negative space pushing outwards from the perspective of being in the center”, yet from outside looking in, it would appear to be matter with no mass. As it gains energy above its rest state it emits “real space” to conserve momentum. The end of the first era of black holes like the one I theorize, leaves us this new state of matter in huge quantities, and an overpressure of hot hydrogen/protoreal virtual dipole soup. Only after the first black holes began to “cool off” into their hypercrystalline spherical shapes, did they “emit negative space” sufficient enough to allow for EM radiation diffusion to lower the proton electron pairs energy levels enough to form REAL hydrogen atoms.",view comment
