We have looked for obvious signs of life on mars and the moon but without really exploring and digging we can’t be certain if there’s currently life or evidence of former life even within our own solar system. Our knowledge of planets in other solar systems is  currently limited to shadows as they pass in front of their stars. Meaning we pretty much know nothing about what those planets actually look like or if they support life. Chances are the universe is full of life, just likely not tons of “intelligent” life like humans.

Using my same analogy as before, if you consider Homo sapiens are the only ones to develop what we consider advanced tools on a planet teeming with life, the odds of life reaching high levels of intelligence is very low.

Conclusion, the universe likely has many worlds with life, though that life likely wouldn’t be able to produce clear evidence of their existence (such as radio waves) currently detectable to us on earth.",view comment

4 - There could be an asteroid on its way to earth, but it would be VERY far away or too small to be a threat to our species if we have not already detected it. The DART mission recently redirected an asteroid which is very promising.

619,,@AngelCatBaby,17/06/23 21:45:30,0,no,no,"Thank you for sharing….great info….????.    
To comment on some other comments…even if we aren’t alone in the universe, Earth is still our jewel in space, and should NEVER be taken for granted.   It is our only home and quite unique in its own right….the abundance of all life we know upon it….all life forms and species of life, cohabiting and living together as one on our planet, depending upon each other for survival, and so far a balanced world, but also becoming unbalanced with humanity’s ignorance????.  Plus, what we find in space now is more or less looking into the past…NOT the present.   So if other forms of life are out there, they might very well be extinct by now or even the planet might be gone because of a catastrophic collision or something else destroying it, such as if the life forms which inhabited it eons ago destroyed it themselves by their own actions, like we can do today with our technological advancements.  So going to one of these other worlds is taking an immense amount of risk involved, including the time involved to get to them…a child one day becomes an ancient elder another day, but still not reaching its destination…..NO family nor friends awaiting our destination.  

Exploring the cosmos might be fun to do, but various radiation levels are also extremely high and dangerous for future travelers and missions to the planets or other star systems, including dealing with other unknowns within the universe.   Another concern is the micrometeorites that can be encountered as well and can penetrate the hulls of spacecrafts surface, damaging the structure and various components, the backbone of operations and oxygen systems.  Plus, at the moment, our technology is far too primitive for anything that requires the knowledge and thinking beyond the box, which humanity hasn’t put itself into, nor the technology that would keep travelers safer in-route.   For that to happen, humanity needs to change its behaviors, attitudes and actions TOWARDS ALL LIFE before venturing forth, for anything worthwhile happens in that scenario, thus and therefore, leaving hatred, greed, racism, narrow minded thinking, selfishness, and egotistical values behind.   Until that happens, traveling among the stars and planets is OUT.   
Wars, hatred and greed have dominated our history and society.  Therefore, we are left with our own choices, priorities and problems to rectify first????, and in compiling humanity’s failures and idiotic decisions.   

We are the CARETAKERS of our planet, THIS IS WHY WE ARE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.   Everything that is currently being thrown away into our oceans, waterways, and landfills, is wasteful and a burden upon our natural resources.   They all should be recycled into other products, all plastics, metal, chemicals, even other materials.   Organic materials could be used as compost or other useful usages.  If humanity is irrational and irresponsible for its own home planet, Earth, then how can humanity survive the rigors of space travel or even survive on other worlds when it misuses everything and has justified it to be as valuable assets?   It cannot.   There is a price to pay for ignorance and/or idiotic behaviors within an uncaring attitude.  Humanity is beginning to see the outcome of those decisions now, with diminishing habitats and declining wildlife populations, including the endangerment of the pollinators…bees and butterflies, which also threatens birds which migrate and eat bugs and insects for their food.  These are the barometer species of our planet.   Various chemicals and that of humanity’s foolishness, are changing our environment and the health of our planet, including our own health, which has weakened the balance of nature and our planet.  Our planet Earth is becoming I’ll.   Our best solution? Recycle everything we use instead of discarding everything into oceans, waterways, and landfills.   A big investment and lots of work, but better for our planet and ecosystem, including our economy, and especially towards developing space travel and exploration.   There will NOT be supplies coming to the rescue if out in space.   

ALL LIFE IS SACRED AND PRECIOUS, and should be given the DIGNITY and REPECT it deserves, without it, we are nothing more than leaches and parasites, consuming everything in site and living a shallow existence…..a mere existence of one’s true self and with a heartless soul.   ????",view comment

Their contributions to science and technology have had a profound impact on modern society, and their knowledge and expertise could be invaluable in addressing some of the challenges facing humanity today.

Here are a few ways that their return could help Earth:

1. Advancing sustainable energy: Both Tesla and Edison were pioneers in the field of energy, and their insights could be invaluable in the development of sustainable energy sources. Tesla, in particular, was an early advocate of renewable energy and envisioned a world powered by clean, sustainable sources like solar and wind power.

2. Improving transportation: Edison and Tesla both had a keen interest in transportation technology and made important contributions to the development of electric cars and other forms of transportation. Their knowledge could be useful in the ongoing effort to reduce carbon emissions and improve transportation efficiency.

3. Advancing communications technology: Tesla was particularly known for his work on wireless communication and radio technology. Edison also contributed to the development of telegraph and telephone technology. With their expertise, they could help to advance modern communication technology even further.

4. Inspiring future generations: Finally, the return of Tesla and Edison could inspire a new generation of scientists and inventors to pursue their passions and make important contributions to science and technology. Their legacy and impact continue to be felt around the world, and their return would undoubtedly spark new ideas and innovations in the years to come.

Overall, the return of Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison would undoubtedly be a remarkable event, and their knowledge and expertise could be valuable in addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today.",view comment

Maybe those other planets aren’t in the right time and are stuck in their beginner stage. Maybe they aren’t technologically advanced yet and are in their “dinosaur” stage. We don’t know because we are seeing these places from millions and billions of years ago. There’s no way to see if there is life on these planets because the telescopes are too weak but they can guess the composition of said planets. Even if there is life, we are not that technologically advanced to even reach these places. We are living in a world with glass windows and all we can do is just look out and guess what is going on out there. & I bet that’s sucks and the voyagers can always run into some trouble out there and probably won’t outlive our planet.
