5,,@SoCaliSurfer13,05/04/24 18:37:16,0,no,no,"Whenever I didn’t know the answer questions in school I would just write down dark matter. And since no one knows exactly what it is I would be able to argue that it is made up of the answer and unless they could tell me what dark matter was and why it wouldn’t be able to be the answer, I shouldn’t have my answer marked incorrect. This actually worked the very first time I tried this because my teachers have never heard of someone using this as a way to answer a question that they didn’t know but when I would try it a second time the novelty wore off, and my answers were marked incorrect. I was honestly shocked that it even worked the first time around, but I definitely pushed my luck too far thinking that I could keep getting away with it.",view comment

These ideas and things he's presenting -- as facts -- are nothing but speculation.., imaginary worlds as real as Hogwort's, or Narnia. He is pure entertainment. No serious Scientists listen to his BS...",view comment
