- If Einstein hadn't come up with relativity and time dilation, we would probably call the time inconsistency observed from two people in space and on Earth ""dark time""
- How do we know dark matter exists? Take a look at a galaxy. From observation we've found out the outermost arms of a galaxy are travelling at a much greater speed compared to what's expected from a simple gravitational force model. This means there must be something there to help hold the arms together.  
- How do we know dark energy exists? It's because of the fact that space is expanding at an increasing speed. Gravity should have been a dominant force in the universe and everything should've been coming together. But instead, there exists a strong mysterious force much stronger than gravity, so strong that it pushes everything away from each other at an increasing speed. We call it ""dark energy""",view comment

134,,@TheNightcrowsNest,14/11/22 18:42:21,1,no,no,I have a hard time believing this one.... Sure someone smart came up with these numbers... BUT... To give absolute number values means we KNOW all the FACTS.  Truth is what we know isn't much... And things we think/thought we know are proving to be wrong....so let's say the universe is round (spherical) like here on earth we have a limited distance in which we can see (or understand) before the curvature of space doesn't allow us to see any further...so I think I'll wait a little longer when we have a way better understanding of our universe before I accept these values in which you present.... Mind you I'll be prehistoric before that happens.,view comment

You don’t a lot of glue, otherwise everything would be stuck, and you a lot of repulsive force, for the universe to expand at a high speed.
That’s why galaxies are fading away(dark energy).
That’s why galaxies have a neighbor (dark matter).
It all has a meaning.
Dark matter also works for our planets, black holes, white holes, stars…
Because if there was no dark matter, everything would fade away with the universe’s expansion.",view comment

does it not more conform to standard scientific practice as well as _common sense_ that if your understanding of something like the universe could only be correct if 20- something percent of the energy in the universe and most of the matter in the universe are invisible to you, and have no other effects except gravity, and surround everything everywhere like the universe is submerged in an invisible ocean, but it doesn't affect us at all... 

is not the *better* answer that that *Our Theory* is what is wrong??!!! 

But, it seems to have occurred to nobody else that the problem is with _our understanding of gravity!_
??

What if you got on a scale that said you weighed 500 pounds,  and you decided to test it by putting a twenty pound weight on it, and the scale said it weighted a hundred pounds? 

Would you say ""Wow there must be a leak of radon gas on here, made up of a super heavy isotope, pressing down on everything!"" ??
or, would you _throw away your bathroom scale and get another one?!_

150,,@sethhenderson9010,14/11/22 19:51:23,0,no,no,I know the answer and the reasons why concerning everything u just said. The reason I don’t say the answer? Because anyone/everyone who would be interested in the answer doesn’t actually want to HEAR the answer or even CONSIDER/CONTRMPLATE if it’s actually true or not. WOMT even try to test it. They say that it’s untestable. But guess what else is untestable that you scientists DO believe tho? DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER. Before u go any further just know that there isn’t any proof and it’s untestable as of right now to actually prove that dark matter and energy even actually exsist. In fact some scientists even say neither exsist and that another explanation is the answer. The answer I have for you has actually already been told to us. It’s the separation of the world and the FIRMAMENT. All that supposed extra weight and energy ARE the Heavens and of course God…I wonder how much god in all his majesty and power weighs along with the place he dwells…but even tho science still cannot even prove or offer any actual concrete evidence that dark matter or dark energy actually exsist will go on to say that I’m wrong and that there’s no gif or heaven and that I’m wrong without PROVING it wrong and without PROVING their own theory. All I’m saying is instead of just saying I’m wrong why don’t u do what scientists do and start to figure out a way to test it to figure it out. Don’t say it’s impossible everything in science was once thought to be something different or even unknowable before someone somewhere at some point in time HAD TO DISCOVER IT. Just cause it wasn’t discovered yet tho didn’t mean that it didn’t exsist or that it’s truthbwasnt true just cause u couldn’t prove it true. All I’m saying is people dismiss the Bible cause of the crazy stories in it right well the Bible was written by humans passed down by humans and we are fallible and so that can make aspects of the Bible fallible also despite what Christian’s may think but one thing despite human kinds fallibility is the fact that GOD himself is not fallible and just cause mistakes passed down over millennia can be found in the Bible DOES NOT PROVE THAT GOD IS NOT REAL AND THAT GOD DID KIT CREATE A HEAVEN THAT HAS BEEN SEPERATED FROM THE WATERS(earth) that we cannot see. We can’t see cells or microorganisms and for most of human history that entire world was u known and as far as the people alive at the time we’re concerned that world didn’t even exsist. All I’m saying is it can still be true today that the heavenly realm just has not been proven yet to exsist because we haven’t found a way to observe it today yet so don’t just dismiss God as being the answer. If science is so fact and evidence based if u have no facts or evidence to prove god isn’t real then you can’t just say gif doesn’t exsist or he’s not real and still claim to be a true scientist. Lastly like I said everything humans have done concerning God is subject to fallibility and therefore any if it cannot be used to directly prove or disprove god since none of it can truly be said to be a true control that we can use and since the Bible cannot be said to be a true control then u cannot use the Bible tans point out something to then say there that’s my proof he does or does not exsist,view comment

444,,@FlaccidFace,17/11/22 02:27:45,0,no,no,"what if dark matter was never an attractive force, and just another type of force. I'll use the big bang theory to explain. Instead of expanding, the big bang could have also had particles pushed past each other in an infinite speed and density, reducing everything to just dark energy (then expanding invertly), and dark matter is simply the leftover force (like the souls of a matter) what we see (normal matter) is what has been pushed apart from the center of chaos. Another theory is using the black and white hole theory. in the universe of black holes, we have normal matter and energy while on the other side of the universe with white holes(maybe black holes for them) are what we refer to dark energy and dark matter. Those effects us just as how normal forces would exist anywhere. It can be the same exact thing, but just something in the parallel world, or in another theory of mine, about time. But that is all in my head and I'm unable to use English to express. just based from my previous 2 explanation on my thoughts is disorganised enough and I don't even know what I'm trying to say at some point, I think you get it.. But ultimately, we are created with different types of components, including normal matter and dark matter, just like how everything should be, balanced. And just like how the first humans were created, created more humans which eventually created other entities such as ai and robots. History just repeats itself, maybe we are in a simulation, and the big bang is just a factory reset button of the universe.",view comment

470,,@A207.,17/11/22 09:43:21,0,no,no,"i already theorized on the space outside of our universe has ""absolute nothingness""
this can make it more accurate bc absolute nothingness basically defies logic and it has no existence, i can't explain it myself but its just where nothing exists that i don't think you can call it ""nothing"" anymore
dark matter is i guess existence but in a sense, dark force is the way existence gets created
i don't think it is existence itself which is why I said ""in a sense""
or here is another one
matter is a ""rule"" applied to this reality universe we are in
dark force is the rule getting spread
think about it, if you put it in a sense, the reality we live in has logic and stuff right?
well other realities may see logic differently from us right?
each reality has rules, the way logic works for them
our rule is based on our creator's imagination, or at least this story's author
dark force is in a symbolizing sense, a force continuing this story forever
dark matter is the empty space in the universe, it seems empty but it still has existence in it
i can see dark matter being divided to other things since spacetime also exist alongside dark matter, just not in the same thing, gravity does bend space time but it doesn't bend dark matter or manipulate it in anyway
dark matter is i guess atoms but it isnt in vision and it's not in size
atoms, sells, those thing hold things together and we are able to see them, it's only so tiny
dark matter is like atoms and sells, it holds things together, dark matter is only different with it not being able to be seen or touched, different from atoms and sells
we might as well not be able to confirm our theories about dark matter ever, unless we are able to make a force similar to that of the dark force",view comment

But as you can see I'm missing the ""missing"" part of the universe 
The universe is expanding and expanding so if more big bangs happen and the big bangs catch up with the universe's dark matter then we may be able to fill up the universe. but clearly that's impossible because different planets are around and the world is not 2D
So it would explode everything if more big bangs came to fill the universe

Many things like planet or astroid belts from other solar system are very dark and nearly impossible to see.
We only relatively recently managed to find planet planets on other solar systems by how they dim the star a tiny bit when they pass in front of it. How many did we not find yet, how many are still dark.

Well, as the universe was being created, an impurity was created in the fabric of space time. This impurity was dark matter, a super dense material with otherworldly properties. As time went on this mass grew and eventually it was so dense, it started emitting radiation. The radiation that was being released was dark energy.

According to me The Dark Matter is the normal matter that's not in our 3D existence (space is made up of 3D but more spatial dimensions but no matter ,energy or us can see or travel to the neighbouring 3D existence (called Spatons)) The matter from the other Spatons are dark matter and we can't interact with in as they are not even in our interactable space .But only gravitational force and Nothing else can pass through Spatons and that's we we fee the gravitational force of dark matter ,but can't see or sense it(no other force can pass through spations ). 

Black holes are a place were inter Spatons matter travel is possible due to its supperior gravitational field that's where all objects heading for singularity go .All objects are multidimensional (for our simplicity say 4D) So objects reach the singularity that's in an different Spatons and hence there 4D travel is possible.",view comment

I’m convinced that gravity range isn’t limited, and instead more like constantly dividing something. Of course, at some point it would be almost negligible, but if you got trillions of stars having 0.000000001% of their gravity reaching you, you still have more than 100% of the average gravity of each of those stars pulling at you (+the gravity of planets,asteroids,dwarf planets,etc)",view comment

They harness the power of the Dyson Sphere and they are on a mission to create a machine with the power collected from as many galaxies they can draw power from that will be able to control dark matter. It’ll act like a black hole, but won’t destroy matter, but rather it’ll collect all the matter in the universe including themselves to create a second Big Bang. At least second in our experience.

Monkeys are currently in the Stone Age and by the time they are a tier 3 civilization, there will be a group of humans somewhere in the universe. As they build this machine to create a second Big Bang, they’ll also figure out a way to separate themselves from this current universe - in short they’ll create a brand new universe while leaving ours unaffected.

This is the multiverse, while different people may be born, the same events will occur regardless.

In the visible spectrum air is dark matter. It doesn't reflect or block the light we see. In the infrared spectrum (which is what they use to capture deep space images) dark matter is just a bunch of little particles that allow infrared photons to pass through without interaction. Dark matter is just matter that isn't hot. It is only true that 4% of space is plasma stars and gass clouds.,view comment

1163,,@superchaz5553,07/01/23 18:35:27,0,no,no,My theory is that dark energy has an atom that’s different to our matter of atoms that keeps the structure of the universe together as well as expanding and with the help of space having no hot temperature and being sub zero; the atoms are joined together so strongly but the thing is and as I’ve said about atoms; the atoms probably have an element inside them aside protons and electrons and nucleuses; but something else to help multiply itself to expand the universe and alongside that; dark matter comes in handy to help expand the universe more outer with its force and the only way in which we get dark energy is if we have the nucleus destroyed in the atom but remade again after being fused with dark matter since part of dark matter will bond with the dark energy in order to create the universe so from in which my opinion the Big Bang was made but I am still thinking that there is still another element to cause the Big Bang since it can’t be just dark matter and dark energy by itself and that there has to be some reactive element that is only obtainable by grabbing the dark energy and trying to add more protons to it through bond with not dark matter since it’s a force but with rock since rock also helped to expand the universe with its strong chemical mixtures bond! And since all other universes are different in matter and physics; this can only be one of many chances that this is the real reason why the Big Bang happened which caused our physics to be like this since that other universes were created in a different way aswell as dark energy and dark matter mixed together but to mix with another sort of element! Also rock does have an element that is usable to obtain such information since that it’s what was first thing created during the Big Bang and that physics in that reality done the rest! Also how we can find dark matter and dark energy is through black holes since that they are the ones made through a corrupted atom that doesn’t have the same chemical type as the one that formed the Big Bang and that it had probably accidentally mixed with another random chemical to cause it to be that way! And that’s why dark energy could possibly loop you to another universe since other universes are possibly made by it so little but so big also! That’s my theory!,view comment

Due to gravity, matter with positive mass attracts other matter with positive mass, so matter with negative mass would repel matter with positive mass. Like, the formula for gravitational pull between 2 objects is a constant multiplied by the result of the mass of the first object times the mass of the second object all divided by the distance between the 2 objects, so if one of the masses is negative then the result is negative, and negative gravitational pull is basically gravitational push. We know that regular matter can only have positive mass, but we don't know that much about dark matter, so for what we know it's possible that dark matter can have negative mass and that this negative mass dark matter was dark energy all along",view comment

They’re all right in front of us but since we are semi-dimensional manifestations of a greater whole, we simply cannot interact with them the way we do with the 4 we inhabit.

We do not see electrons and atoms, our eyes cannot interact with matter itself. What we see is the wavelengths those objects give off when exposed to light. 

So all matter is invisible. What we see is energy, not matter. 

Dark matter is matter which doesn’t interact with light. All matter is dark
Matter in the absence of light. 

But light matter can still interact with sound waves, as echolocation works when there is no light. 

So maybe there is a gravitational equilivalent of echolocation that we have yet to discover. Some “vision” that detects regions of extra gravity and uses that to map out where objects are. And from that we can see dark matter as it only interacts with gravity. 

I believe more strongly that dark matter is a consequence of our mathematical models being inaccurate. But the idea of all matter being invisible really trips you out and makes it seem like dark matter could be a real physical object.",view comment

- 4-D Hypershere model of Universe can easily explain Gravitation, Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Void, Accelerated Expansion and even the reason why the measurement values of Expansion Rate are around 70 km/sec-Mpc 

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Void and Antigravity, ... all these are same phenomena. They just look different.
The problem of modern physics is they're trying to explain everything with particle physics and the physics is being cornered more and more to the dead end. To escape the dead end, they invent or design another imaginary particle in vain instead of trying to revise their way to approach to the problem.

I agree to the idea that the interaction between mass and space must be explained with quantum mechanics.
But that doesn't mean gravity is the QM phenomena.
That's because gravity is not a force.
Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Gravity, Antigravity, Void... all these are  just  joint effects of the expansion of the Universe and the curvature of spacetime.
Details are given below.

Einstein’s theory of General Relativity states that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass. 
This curvature influences the motion other objects with mass and gives rise to gravitation.
Thus, gravity is a result of geometric features in spacetime.
However, we also observe gravitational effects – curvature of spacetime – in areas without any detectable mass.
This has given rise to the concept of dark matter, which is matter that does not interact in any detectable way with normal matter, except through gravity.
So, there is some large quantity of dark matter scattered throughout the universe, which curves spacetime and causes gravitational effects just like normal matter, but we cannot see or detect it with any known method.

An alternative theory to the identity of dark matter is proposed – it is not matter at all, but rather an intrinsic curvature of spacetime.
In other words, spacetime is not naturally flat. Even in the absence of matter, we observe some inherent curvature of spacetime.

So, the question is now – why is spacetime naturally curved? Why is it not flat in the absence of mass?
The universe is 4-dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension in time.
Rather than consider time as a linear dimension, we can consider it as a radial one.
Therefore, rather than describing the universe with a Cartesian coordinate system, we describe it with a 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system – 3 angular coordinates, ?1, ?2, ?3, and one radial coordinate in time, t.
We live on the 3-dimensional surface of a 4-dimensional bubble which is expanding radially in time.
Thus, the Big Bang represents t=0, the beginning of time.
The crucial point is that the expansion of the universe is not homogeneous in all directions.

The expansion rate at one point on the bubble’s surface may differ slightly from another point near it.
The universe is only roughly spherical in 4 dimensions, the same way that the Earth is only roughly spherical in 3 dimensions.
The same way we observe local mountains and valleys on the surface of Earth, we observe local “mountains” and “valleys” on the surface of the universe bubble.
The inhomogeneity of the expansion of the universe has given rise to natural curvature of spacetime. This natural curvature causes the phenomenon of “dark matter”. “Valleys” in spacetime pull matter in, similarly to the warping of spacetime of massive objects.
So “dark matter” is really “valleys” in spacetime that are expanding slower than the regions surrounding it.
These valleys tend to pull matter in and create planets, stars, and galaxies – regions of space with higher-than-average densities of mass.
Conversely, “mountains” in spacetime will repel matter away, an “anti-gravitational” effect, which gives rise to cosmic voids in space where we observe no matter.
Each point on the surface of the universe bubble traces out a time arrow in 4-dimensional space, perpendicular to the surface.
These time arrows are not parallel to each other since the universe is not flat.
This causes points to have nonzero relative velocity away from each other.
It is generally accepted that the universe is expanding faster than observable energy can explain, and this is expansion is believe to be still accelerating.
The “missing” energy required to explain these observations has given rise to the theory of dark energy.
The time dilation caused by non-parallel time arrows can be proposed as an explanation for dark energy.

Alternatively, dark energy is real energy coming from potential energy gradients caused by non-parallel time arrows.
As a sanity check, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe based on the universe bubble model.
Since the radius of the universe bubble is expanding at the speed of light in the time direction, it increases at 1 light second per second.
Therefore, the “circumference” of the 3-dimensional surface increases by 2? light seconds per second, or about 1.88*10^6 km/s.
This expansion is distributed equally across the 3-dimensional surface, so the actual observed expansion rate is proportional to the distance from the observer.

At present, the age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years, so the radius of the universe bubble is 13.8 billion light years, or about 4233 megaparsecs (3.26 million light years to 1 Mpc).

Thus, we can calculate the expansion rate of the universe, per megaparsec from the observer, as: 

Expansion rate = ((d(circumference))/dt)/radiusofuniverse=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/(2?*4233Mpc)=(1.88*?10?^6 km?s)/26598Mpc=70.82(km?s)/Mpc

The popularly accepted empirical expansion rate is 73.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, so our calculated value is close.
There may be some additional source of expansion (or observed red shift) to make up for the discrepancy. For example, if two adjacent points have some gravitational gradient due to non-parallel time arrows, then light passing through these points will be red-shifted.
